15759838,"Life's Rhythms is full of beautiful poems. If you want to be inspired then you should definitely read Vickie's poems. I did not want to rush through either of the books. How can I describe how I felt when reading the poems? I wanted to enter the poem and feel the emotions. Kind of like sitting in my rocker looking out into the piney woods that surround my house. I feel the trees swaying, birds and squirrels playing. Reading her poems were like that, inspiring, heart felt and full of wonder. An emotional experience. 
 I reviewed two of the author's books of poems on my blog. Life's Rhythms and Kaleidoscope combining them in one review. 
 I highly recommend this book.

 I received a free copy of these books from the author for review. I was in no way compensated for this review. It is my own opinion.",1
15759838,"Life's Rhythms is a great selection of traditional haiku. There is beauty as well as current themes reflecting nature and man's misuse of it. The cover art as well I found appropriate and symbolic of the contents. That said, there were a few issues, not so much with the writing as personal taste. I found the 5-7-5 form a bit constrictive. I think the author should have switched it up with 3-5-3 or other variants. Or thrown in an extra syllable for the hell of it. I love traditional haiku but I find it wears on me if I read it in a large volume such as this. The nature themes as well were nice but I would have liked to see Johnstone write with a more personal touch at times.",1

All the ""truths"" and ""red pill wisdom"" are just regurgitations that have been written before by better men. One of the lines he writes in here is that ""we are who we say we are"" which is stupid as fuck. Rollo talks a big game online but you see pictures of him at beta convention aka 21 and he looks like a pussy. 
 The first rule of anything red pilled is to lift. And if a guy doesn't lift then he's useless. Also he's married and only produced one kid, very beta.",0
18634307,"Interesting book on gender communication and roles. 
 Would I recommend this book to read? 
 It has merits, and there is a significant amount of truth to it that warrant reading. 
 Personally, I don't agree with everything in the book. 
 Having said that, there is value in knowing different kinds of ""truth"", in order to reach your own version of the truth.

26345942,"To be perfectly honest, I did not like it much as I started reading but that changed soon. Almost as soon as the second chapter. From then on, it was a ride on which I could not predict what was going to be the next destination. Or rather the road traveled. 
 Filled with witty anecdotes here and there and one woman's desire to stand independent on her own, it is a formula of light hearted chick lit. 
 With the intermingling of heart's desire and the brain's logic, it is a perfect book to read for an enjoyable time.",0
26345942,"What an intriguing idea for a novel! A female PI is always a good start as strong female characters that can take of their own problems are too far and few between in the reading world. But Vanna goes further than most. She goes to the extreme. I really liked Vanna and I could feel her pain. But she also drove me a bit nuts as she continued to hold onto something that was gone. Especially when she had something hot and steamy (aka Ringo) to fill her cold nights. 
 Although the novel was well written and witty, it got redundant in places. There were tons and tons of references to the animal kingdom. I found myself skipping some of it. Then there was the psychological mumbo jumbo and the bitterness about men and their inability to be faithful. I understand Vanna's viewpoint. Really, I do, but she did drive me nuts with her one-track negativity at times. 
 I was a bit worried about how this novel would finish. Would it finish? Or leave me hanging? It was actually a good ending for the story. There's plenty of fodder for another novel but Corrigan didn't leave me hanging.",0
26345942,"I received this book as an arc for a honest review. I throughly enjoyed Vanna Treme, private investigator, hater of cheating men. Ringo, her assistant is hot with principles. The book is based in Florida, and Vanna's clients are rich wives from Palm Beach wanting to catch their cheating husbands. Motto: ""Men. You can't live with them. You can't kill them...Or can you?"" Cheating husbands call for extreme measures. Loved the characters, and especially the parrots. I did think the vet was a little long winded but all in all a good entertaining read.",1

 OMG that ending. I lost count on how many times I read the last few chapters. I love how everyone was able to come together in the end and kick some major ass. I cried and I laughed during reading this book. Once I was done my soul and heart were shattered. 
 Sky finally gets to find her human family and gets to know them and of course she has another sister, who is human, and of course this sister ends up with Olivier. Sky comes into herself in this book and finally finds out what her purpose is in the battle. She is the one who finally kills Lucifer but in order to do that she must let Jack die but girls done start crying yet cause... *CASP* he was able to come back due to Sky's sacrifice, though it took him 3 years to find her due to losing his memories (he slowly got them back). They live happily ever after. 
 Olivier is the biggest shocker for me. He helped during the battle and was able to actually meet GOD and for all that he has done for the vampires and his bravery he was able to ask for something in return. He wanted something he always wanted deep in his heart... HE BECAME A VAMPIER... From what I get he goes back to New York and helps rebuild everything and I think he becomes the leader of the coven. Sky's human sister, Finn, becomes a conduct and Olivier's familiar. They live happily ever after 
 Mimi and Jack couldn't kill one another in the last book so in order to get released from their bond they have to have the person who did it undo it and of course that's Lucifer. So they pretty much become spies for the Light. We don't really get an inside look of Jacks side of things which I wish we did but it mainly follows Mimi and her journey of trying to help the coven from the inside and keep her true feelings for Kinsley away from Lucifer. In the end Lucifer was never fooled and sent them out to kill their true love. Mimi couldn't do this and instead tried to find a way of telling Kinsley what was going on without telling him. He figures this all out and in the end Mimi is able to break free from Lucifer's claws and helps kick ass in the final battle alongside Kinsley and the other Venators. 
 Jack in the whole thing is cold and distant. Not really able to see his side of things we find out in the end that he knew they would never be able to fool Lucifer so Jack set in motion his own deception. In the end Jack dies but is given the gift to return but doesn't have his memories but slowly over 3 years he gets them back and sets off to find Sky. Once he does they live happily ever after. 
 Mimi and Kingsley decide to not go back to paradise or Earth but go back to the underworld and help re-build it and make it as grand as it can be. They are finally free to bond with one another and live happily. 
 Bliss plays a part in the final battle with bringing the hellhounds into the mix. She falls for the leader Lawson (Bliss has her own books about her journey of getting the hellhounds) and in the end her mother gives her the gift of wolf. 
 There are a few deaths in the end so beware. 
 This book is probably the best out of them all cause you finally get the whole picture, about what happen in Florence, how Bliss was conceived, why Allegra no longer loved Michael and turned to her human familiar, Sky's true family history, and so much more. Its a must read.",0

17347049,"So I am not going to go into details or try and sell this book. Gates of Paradise is the seventh book in the Blue Blood series and that's not even counting the three other books (Bloody Valentine, Keys to the Repository and Wolf Pact) that fit into this series. That means that you know the story and characters by now, they are old friends (or enemies) and you either want to see the story through or not. 
 Gates of Paradise was a fantastic end to the Blue Blood series. So many things were wrapped up and it had a steady pace until we reached the end and then all Hell broke loose (quite literally in their case). The ended revealed something I knew to be true in my heart, it had action, heartbreaking loss, deaths and at the end salvation for some. Gates of Paradise proves once again how great the Blue Blood series really was. For those who don't know there is one book, Vampires of Manhattan, and it's a spin-off of the Blue Bloods world so you don't have to let go just yet. Unfortunately I do believe that, that will be the only book, bet than nothing I say.",0

581607,"This is another case of buying the book for a college class, not being assigned anything from it, and feeling like I should actually read it since I paid for it. I thought I might like it better than I liked any of her actual writing (I'm normally a sucker for journal entries or letters), but alas. I found myself being annoyed at her constant ""I'm thrilled with everything/I'm so depressed; I'm ecstatic at the positive reviews/crushed by the negative reviews/I don't care about reviews a whit; I can't write/I have been writing so easily and well/what is the point of writing"". I understand the emotional pull of writing but felt really frustrated by her woe-is-me attitude. Perhaps I'm not sympathetic enough to have fully appreciated this book.",1

25026385,"Ich finde es so gut wie unmoglich hier eine Rezi fur jedermann zu verfassen. Daher habe ich mich entschieden diese Rezension in zwei Abschnitte einzuteilen. So kann jeder je nach seiner jeweiligen Vorerfahrung mit der Reihe zum richtigen Abschnitt wechseln. 
 Rezension fur Neulinge der Reihe (allgemeiner Inhalt der Reihe) 
 Man muss die Bucher dieser Reihe wirklich in der richtigen Reihenfolge lesen. Der Weltaufbau und die Handlung bauen extrem aufeinander auf und das ganze wird sonst sehr verwirrend und macht wenig Sinn. Daher werde ich in diesem Abschnitt auch nur allgemein auf die Welt und Handlung der Reihe eingehen und bitte jeden Leser dann wirklich mit Band 1 (""Wachter der Nacht"")anzufangen. 
 Das ganze ist Urban-Fantasy - es gibt hier also magische Wesen (da zahle ich jetzt auch mal magische Menschen dazu) aber diese leben in unserer realen Welt. Das ganze hat Lukianenko sehr gut durchdacht und einen komplexen Weltaufbau geschaffen. Die magischen Wesen (Gestaltwandler, Vampire, Hexen, Zauberer...) leben unter den Menschen, ohne das diese davon etwas mitbekommen. Grob unterteilen sich alle magischen Bewohner der Welt in Dunkle und Lichte. Einige werden bereits in dem Wissen geboren, andere entdecken ihre Magie erst spater im Leben und werden dann initiiert. Das heisst sie mussen sich fur eine Seite entscheiden. Ein ganz wichtiger Punkt dieser Reihe ist es nicht nur die Konflikte zwischen diesen beiden Gruppen zu thematisieren, sondern vor allem auch den Leser dazu anzuregen daruber nachzudenken, dass nicht alles Dunkle wirklich bose ist und auch die Lichten vielleicht nicht immer moralisch korrekt agieren. Das macht der Autor unglaublich geschickt, ohne dass man das Gefuhl hat belehrt zu werden. Er erreicht das durch seine unglaublich starke und sympathische Hauptfigur Anton. Mit ihm schaut man hinter die Fassaden der Dunklen und Lichten und fiebert mit ihm mit, sich richtig zu entscheiden oder mit falschen Entscheidungen zu leben. Es gibt eine Tag- und eine Nachtwache, die sich gegenseitig uberwachen. Grosses Thema ist das Gleichgewicht dieser beiden Machte und das ist in so gut wie jedem Band der Reihe auf irgend eine Art gefahrdet. Anton entscheidet sich zwar in Band 1 fur eine Seite aber hinterfragt seine Entscheidung bzw. die Vorgehensweisen jeder Seite immer wieder. Zum Beispiel wird das Toten von Menschen durch die Nachtwache (also die Lichten) reglementiert. Sie erteilen Lizenzen zum Toten an die Dunklen und uberwachen, ob sie sich daran halten. Die Dunklen im Gegenzug bestimmen wie viele Zauber fur das Gute angewendet werden durfen. Ideal sollte somit ein Gleichgewicht zwischen guten und schlechten Interventionen in der Menschenwelt hergestellt werden. Ein weiteres ganz wichtiges Element ist das Zwielicht - eine Art Schatten- oder Parallelwelt. Dieses lernt man erst nach und nach kennen, weil es sehr komplex ist und nur von den Anderen (magischen Wesen) betreten werden kann. Je nach Rang des Anderen kann er bestimmte Ebenen darin betreten und diese dann auch fur bestimmte Dinge nutzen. Aber das lernt der Leser nach und nach in den Banden. 
 Das allein ist schon sehr interessant, aber Lukianenko macht das ganze auch noch durch vielen Geheimnisse spannend. Man ratselt immer wieder mit, wird auf falsche Fahrten geleitet und oft uberrascht. 
 Gewohnungsbedurftig fur einige Leser wird wohl der Schreibstil von Herrn Lukianenko sein. Mir gefallt er unglaublich gut, weil er einzigartig ist. Er schreibt oft recht kuhl (und hat mich doch das ein oder andere Mal zu Tranen geruhrt), teilweise philosophisch und mit einem russischen Stil. 
 Mich hat Anton immer begeistern konnen. Er ist ein genialer Protagonist, den man gern begleitet. Seine Gewissenskonflikte konnte ich immer gut nachvollziehen und teilweise auch seine Wut auf bestimmte Personen in seinem Umfeld. Im Laufe der Reihe muss er schwerwiegende Entscheidungen treffen, die er sich nie leicht macht. Aber auch die Nebencharaktere sind einfach so genial. Allen voran Geser, der Leiter der Nachtwache/Lichten und Sebulon, der Leiter der Tagwache/Dunklen. Diese beiden sind sehr speziell und man durchschaut sie so gut wie nie. Teilweise sind sie recht skrupellos, dann helfen sie wieder Anton oder man empfindet sie als sehr menschlich. Ich fand die Stellen, wo diese beiden ihre Auftritte hatten immer besonders interessant. Anton bekommt im Laufe der Reihe auch eine Frau an seine Seite und grundet eine Familie. Das wurde ebenfalls genial umgesetzt, ohne das es gross romantisch wird. 
 Rezension fur Kenner der Reihe(speziell auf diesen Band bezogen) 
 So, wer doch noch etwas allgemein zu meiner Meinung zum Weltaufbau, Handlung und Charakteren der Reihe lesen mochte, der muss doch den oberen Abschnitt lesen. Wer allerdings die Reihe schon bis Band 5 kennt, braucht das eigentlich nicht. Hier werde ich nun ganz speziell auf diesen letzten Band der Reihe eingehen. 
 Vom Stil her bleibt sich der Autor treu. Er hat eben seinen ganz eigenen, unverkennbaren Schreibstil. Ich personlich liebe ihn. 
 Inhaltlich habe ich lange Zeit geschwankt, ob ich nun 4 oder 5 Sterne geben soll. Leider gab es schon Abschnitte, die ich etwas langgezogen und teilweise zu philosophisch und wiederholt empfand. Doch dann kam das grosse Finale, dass mich echt gepackt hat und zum Schluss etwas atemlos zuruck liess. Mit solch einem Ende hatte ich wirklich nicht gerechnet und ich muss gestehen, dass auch ein, zwei Tranchen geflossen sind. Anton kampft in diesem Band meist nicht ganz allein, sondern mit Sweta und Nadja zusammen. Vor allem Nadjas Rolle hat mich sehr uberrascht - positiv uberrascht. Das Madchen hat sich wirklich entwickelt und ich habe sowohl ihre Interaktionen mit ihren Eltern als auch ihre magischen Aktionen sehr begeistert. Das Zwielicht spielt wieder eine grosse Rolle. Den Tiger kennen wir ja bereits und er hat auch hier wieder viel mit der Handlung zu tun, aber es kommt nun noch eine weitere Gestalt dazu. Diese ist auch wieder sehr interessant und macht das gesamte Buch spannend. Es wird namlich die ganze Zeit nach einer Moglichkeit gesucht diesen zu bekampfen, herauszufinden wer oder was er eigentlich genau ist und warum er so eine grosse Bedrohung fur die ganze Welt darstellt. Dabei trifft man noch einmal auf alle grossen Gruppen der Reihe - die Hexen, Vampire, Gestaltwandler, den Tiger und die Lichten und Dunklen. Das fand ich sehr gut fur einen Abschlussband. Uberhaupt ist die Handlung der ganzen Reihe damit gekonnt beendet worden und das Ende war wirklich atemberaubend, mitreissend und uberraschend. 
 Anton hat in diesem Band noch einen heimlichen Helfer und auch das machte das Buch spannend. Ich habe die ganze Zeit uberlegt wer es nun ist und warum er/sie ihm hilft. 
 Fur mich war es ein toller Abschluss der Reihe und jeder Fan des Autors bzw. des Wachter Zyklus sollte ihn lesen. 
 Grundidee 5/5 
 Schreibstil 4,5/5 
 Spannung 4/5 
 Emotionen 4/5 
 Charaktere 5+/5 
 Liebesgeschichte 2/5 (ist aber auch nicht wichtig fur das Buch) 
 *Fazit:* 
 4,6 von 5 Sternen 
 Ich liebe diese Reihe und kann sie jedem Urban-Fantasy Fan empfehlen, der auf romantische Liebesgeschichten verzichten kann und sich auf einen ganz eigenen, teilweise recht kuhlen Schreibstil einlassen kann. Die Reihe ist spannend und uberraschend. Auch dieser letzte Band hat mich wirklich gefesselt, uberrascht, am Schluss sogar zu Tranen geruhrt und atemlos zuruckgelassen. Ich freue mich schon auf die neue Reihe des Autors die im September herauskommt. (""Licht und Dunkelheit"")

26237590,"Very well done! This story earned my interest right away and kept it all the way through. It was very suspenseful and a little sad in parts, but kept me wanting to read. 
 I love that is was a historical mystery (1800's, set in Chicago). I always love a good historical story! 
 The character development was done very well. I really grew to know and like most of the characters (some you weren't suppose to like). The author stayed true to the historical time period. The characters really felt like they were from the 1800's. I also love books with a strong positive female lead and this one had that! Cady was awesome :-) 
 Just tiny parts of this book were a little slow, that's why the four stars instead of five, but for the most part - a very good read! 
 This is the first book I have read by this author. I am sure I will read more! I had no idea that this was the third book in a series, but that didn't seem to affect me. I was fine reading it, I didn't feel like I was missing anything and I wasn't confused. 
 Pssst - I liked the cover too! 
 Thank you ""Reading Addiction Virtual Book Tours"" for sending my this book for my honest review!

26237590,"Set in 1800's Chicago, A Wicked Truth is a romantic mystery full of twists and turns. 
 The story grabs you and keeps you turning page after page until you realize that it is over. 
 Cady is an intriguing character, at first I didn't like her, I felt her too weak and condoning with Doyle, until she starts developing her own voice and it's a pretty one. Doyle is a complex character, full of secrets and a troubled past. Both have great chemistry, they are a handsome couple. 
 Regarding the plot, the storyline space fluctuates, some chapters goes fast and others are a bit slow, it haves some great dialogues, twists and turns and amazing scenes that would leave you asking what's going to happen? 
 The time period and descriptions of the 1800's are impeccable, you can see that the Author has done a great amount of research. 
 Highly Recommended to all type of readers.

26237590,"Review: 
 A Wicked Truth might be called a good old 'Who Done It'. While on the surface the story is about Cady and Doyle 's preparations for their upcoming nuptials, Doyle is doing a favor for a friend, trying to find a missing sister. In the process, this digs up all kinds of things in Doyle's past that are best left buried. Cady handles it all with much more grace than I would, even now when I'm supposed to be 'wise' and 'mature' although at some points I'm not sure I wouldn't have said, 'See ya' and been out of there so fast it would have made his head spin! Though it all, however, their love seemed to grow until they reached that pivotal point where it was time to pee or get off the pot. What did they choose? Ah now, where would the fun be in me telling you? It's a mystery after all! 
 I have to say, nothing had prepared me for the fact that this is actually part of a series - third book actually. Just like the Nancy Drew Mysteries before her, this is the Cady Delafield Series. Each book stands alone so it was no problem that I didn't know. I am a huge fan of history and that is part of what interested me in A Wicked Truth. Set in 1800's Chicago, it was true to date, style, character and dress. Nothing Joyce had the characters day or do jolted me out of the era and I really appreciated that. It was just an overall well written and enjoyable book. 
 Rating: 5 Stars 
 Heat: 1/5 - Tame 
 *I received this book in exchange for my honest and open-minded review. No further compensation was received.",1
26237590,"This historical fiction slash mystery suspense got me up all night. My eyes got wide from the moment I read the bloody prologue and continued to feel nervous as the chapters progressed. 
 Cady Delafield was a force, a paradox. At first, I didn't understand how and why she had chosen to be a martyr, to accept whatever dirty little secrets her betrothed Doyle Flannagan was hiding. (Maybe it had to do with the fact that I wasn't able to read the first book in the series). 
 Nevertheless, Cady had grown on me and I soon realized that there was more than met the eye. Their partnership was remarkably astounding, their chemistry sizzling. Even the timeline (Chicago in the 1880s) was magnificently depicted. I never thought I'd fully appreciate the beauty and wonders last century brought to the story. 
 Joyce Proell is an effective author and a really talented one at that. The mystery surrounding the characters really made it hard for me to put this book down! The suspense literally killed me!",3

 Tutti i suoi romanzi, ed anche questo, sono sia delle finestre sulla quotidianita dell'epoca che vere e proprie denunce sulla poverta e le terribili condizioni di vita in cui la bassa societa era costretta e che ha provato anche il piccolo Charles per un periodo della sua vita. Scrooge, il protagonista, e una caricatura satirica dei pezzi grossi del Capitalismo vittoriano che affamavano il popolo; magari con i suoi libri-denuncia sperava di far breccia nei cuori di questi signorotti arricchiti e cambiare le cose, ma caro mio ci vuol ben altro!

207471,"His name is prot. Is he mad? Or could his strange story really be true? 
 Prot claims that he is from the planet K-PAX, a utopia where there is no such thing as murder or crime, government does not exist, everyone lives in harmony and the beings all have the ability of light travel. 
 The story is told from the point of view of Prot's psychiatrist or doctor 'Gene' while he is staying in the Metropolitan Institude for the clinicall ill. The chapters take the form of sessions in which Gene (the same name as the author) tries to unravel what he believes to be prot's delusions and help him find his real self. 
 The book has twists and turns and keeps you hooked right up until the breathtaking denoument of surprising consequence. 
 The audience are left to make their own minds up as to whether prot really is from K-Pax and if you really want to know then i urge you to read the set. This is the classic and rightly so but they are all just as enlightening as the others. Prot's wisdom is in itself worth the read, he seems like a Christ like figure or a Gandhi type; curing the patients of MPI under the agitated eyes of the doctors and smiling at the flagrant misuse humans have put to their world. 
 I have rarely been so impressed from a novel and this has spurred me onto a rollercoaster ride of reading science fiction.

12037528,"Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor -- and the omnibus ""Jane Austen - Four Novels"" brings together four of her most enduring novels (although admittedly the overall list is rather small) -- filled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories. 
 ""Pride and Prejudice"" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. 
 And ""Sense and Sensibility"" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable. And ""Northanger Abbey"" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. 
 ""Emma"" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. 
 The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the foul Eltons). 
 And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly --each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (""The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows""), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (""I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine""). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well. 
 Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie). 
 ""Jane Austen's - Four Novels"" draws together her best round of novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.",0
55274,"""The Collected Letters of"" generally means, or at least so I assumed, drudgery and boredom. Lewis's are instead bursting with fun and humanity: thoughts on books with friends, points of theology with strangers, multitudinous thanks for Americans who donated food to the English after the second World War (actually, this last part is by far the least interesting of anything Lewis ever wrote). But the letters between Lewis and his brother or Arthur Greeves, or Dorothy Sayers or Tolkien, or the Italian priest who started a correspondence in Latin, or even the goofiness of the mock-Middle English letters with ER Eddison make excellent reading. It reminds me of reading Boswell (not least because Lewis is continuously quoting Johnson) in that it's like being up close and personal with a great intellect and a great man in his off hours. You see all kinds of new things to like and admire. 
 This is a great cooling-off book as well. There's no argument to follow, no symbolism to be on the look out for--(I think I read most of when I couldn't sleep and during the commercials of football games)-- it's just an immersion into wartime Oxford, and it makes for fascinating stuff.",0

Boring, so many cliches have been used and the characters didn't interest me at all. This felt really calculated and made for big marketing and for making money. And I'm not sure if the writer knows anything about cats so does she just make them how it works for the story. And also, I hope people don't get the idea from this book that cats belong to nature -> they are not in their natural habitat and they unbalance the natural ecosystem. This just made me frustrated.",0

 Nu am citit seria Urzeala Tronurilor si nu stiu daca o voi face sau cand o voi face, numarul mare de pagini si de personaje fiind unele dintre impedimentele care imi stau in cale. Am fost insa curioasa de stilul lui George R.R. Martin, si probabil inca voi mai fi pana voi mai citit alte carti de-ale lui. 
 Dupa cum ziceam, curioasa fiind de stilul autorului, am zis sa testez Cavalerul celor sapte regate, o carte care contine trei povestiri a caror actiune se petrece inainte de Urzeala Tronurilor. Cu siguranta ca fanii seriei au fost extrem de incantati de aceasta aparitie, iar ceilalti, printre care m-am numarat si eu, au fost curiosi sa vada ce se regaseste printre paginile acestei lecturi. 
 Stilul lui George R.R. Martin mi s-a parut unul fain, destul de simplist fata de ceea ce imi imaginam eu, facand astfel lectura una lejera si placuta. Cartea este impartita in trei povestiri: Cavalerul ratacitor, Sabia jurata si Cavalerul misterios. 
 Cu toate ca la inceput am parut destul de intrata in povestea expusa de Martin, pe parcurs nu am mai fost la fel de atrasa. Problema nu cred ca a fost legata de personaje sau de subiectul in sine, ci mai degraba de neconcordanta dintre stilul cartii si gusturile mele. 
 Este o carte fantasy, dar nu am reusit sa ma apropii de ea prea mult, lucru care m-a dezamagit un pic, pentru ca aveam senzatia ca aveam sa fiu impresionata. Am vazut multe note bune pentru aceasta carte, dar mai mult de 3 stelute nu am reusit sa ii ofer. Nu am nimic de comentat despre stilul autorului, sau despre personajele create si intamplarile prin care trec. Nu am simtit insa o legatura sufleteasca cu aceasta lectura, si nici nu am fost impresionata in mod special de ceva anume, aspect care ar fi ridicat nota cartii cu cel putin o steluta. :-) 
 Personajele principale, cavalerul Dunk si ajutorul sau Egg, m-au plictisit de multe ori, insa au fost si momente cand le-am apreciat in aventurile prin care trec. Sunt curioasa daca mi-ar fi placut mai mult aceste povestiri in cazul in care as fi citit deja seria GoT despre care se vorbeste atat de mult. Cred ca autorul poate mai mult decat ceea ce am descoperit in Cavalerul celor Sapte Regate asa ca probabil voi incerca sa vad cum este primul volum din seria Urzeala Tronurilor. 
 Citate: 
 ""O stea cazatoare aduce noroc celui ce o vede, s-a gandit Dunk. Dar toti ceilalti sunt de acum in pavilioanele lor, privind un strat de matase, si nu cerul. Asa ca norocul e doar al meu."" (p.26) 
 ""Pe cand vaslisera in josul Sangelui Verde, fetele orfane frecau in joaca teasta rasa a lui Egg, sa le aduca noroc, si el rosea, mai ceva ca o rodie. 
 - Fetele sunt atat de proaste, spunea Egg. Daca se mai atinge vreuna de mine, ajunge in rau. 
 La care Dunk trebuia sa-i raspunda: 
 - Te-ating eu atunci. O sa-ti trag o scatoalca peste ureche de-o s-auzi clopote o luna intreaga. Asta nu facea decat sa-l intarate si mai mult. 
 - Mai bine clopote decat fete proaste, insista el, dar n-a aruncat niciodata in rau."" (p.149-150) 
 ""- N-oi fi fost eu la Ashford, dar turnirurile sunt painea mea. Le urmaresc de departe, asa cum un maestru urmareste stelele. Stiu cum un anume cavaler ratacitor a provocat un duel judiciar de sapte, care a condus la moartea lui Baelor Sfarma-Lance de mana fratelui sau, Maekar. Ser Uthor se aseza si-si intinse picioarele: Printul Baelor era foarte iubit. Printul Stralucitor avea si el prieteni, care nu vor fi uitat cauza exilului sau. Gandeste-te la oferta mea, ser. Poate ca melcul lasa o dara murdara in urma lui, dar putina murdarie nu face niciun rau...in timp ce, daca dansezi cu dragonii, s-ar putea sa te arzi."" (p.320)",4

 .......................................... 
 Cat mai e de asteptat pana la urmatorul volum din serie Cantec de gheata si foc, nimeni nu stie, asa ca, intre timp te mai poti distra cu ceva gen Cavalerul celor sapte regate, sau cu serialul, sau benzile desenate etc. Ei bine, cele trei scurte nuvele care-i au ca protagonisti pe Ser Duncan Vlajganul si pe Aegon Targaryen a.k.a. Egg sunt o intoarcere cat se poate de placuta in ,,haosul"" care este Westeros-ul lui Martin. 
 Foarte multe nu ar fi de spus despre carte. Scriitura specifica lui Martin, personaje noi, dar tipologia acestora este usor de recunoscut, acelasi univers violent si plin de eroism cu care ne-au obisnuit personajele pozitive din seria mare, insa mult mai putin sex si desfatare gurmanda, asta-i cert. Umorul sarcastic nu lipseste si este la fel de savuros. Avem parte de turniruri care se intind pe zeci de pagini si care fac deliciul a doua povestiri. Este si un complot politic demascat de Aegon si Ser Dunk, conform dulcelui stil consacrat deja al scriitorului american.

12680907,"Is this really the last book in the series? I hope Cashore isn't done with the Graceling realm, because I genuinely loved these books. Bitterblue was no exception. 
 First, if you, like me, didn't get enough Katsa and Po and the rest of their Scooby Gang in the first book, they're back for more. The beloved Council has expanded their antics from basic Robin Hood stuff to actual revolutionary tactics, and Bitterblue herself, now the young queen of Monsea, is in on everything. While Katsa and Po together supply a fair amount of hilarity, this book is perhaps the darkest of the three, focusing on a kingdom's struggle to reconcile with its past and heal from a psychotic, manipulative despot's 35-year rule. As such, it expands upon many of the themes explored in previous books and plays out a bit differently. Rather than traveling around with the Council members as they spread justice and birth control (jk...kind of) throughout the kingdoms, readers stay put with Bitterblue as she unravels the mysteries of her personal and national past. 
 This book really showed Cashore's care in plotting out the entire series as a whole, and I really appreciated the way she established and gradually built up her universe and characters. There's a twisty, enjoyable plot and several fun fantasy elements, but the people supply the story's beating heart. I won't lie: sometimes the characters are a bit annoyingly perfect, if not in their actions then in their genuine desire to do the right thing alllll the time. Yet I still loved them and wanted to befriend and go on adventures with them. Without giving too much away, Cashore also does a great job tying up the loose threads of the series cleanly without resorting to schmaltz or ""happily ever after."" There's room for your imagination to work it's own magic on what's to happen. Or just more books! 
 On a final note, I so wish I'd read these when I was a young adult. In addition to the action and romance, the series does a wonderful job presenting loving non-heternormative and non-traditional relationships and destigmatizing healthy, consensual pre-marital sex. I know there's a lot of that out there now, but I remember a YA universe full of Twilight-type messaging. How refreshing and promising that the world has changed, is changing, and that literature is reflecting and promoting it.",0
12680907,"I believe I was supposed to read Fire before reading this one, but oh well. Didn't really seem to make much difference. 
 Kristen Cashore has a talent for captivating me with her prose. I find it effortless and wonderful, and I really appreciate the humor that pops up. And having loved Graceling and placing it up there as one of my favorite books, I had high expectations for Bitterblue. And for most of the book, I was prepared to clap and sing praises for it and give it five stars plus. Alas, Bitterblue suffered from a lagging midsection. It is not a terrible affliction, as I still eagerly turned pages, but it felt liked everything slowed down at a point about halfway through, and then instead of climbing back upward to an exciting climax, it was more of a gentle uphill journey. 
 Don't get me wrong, I still found it thoroughly enjoyable. The characters are so well fleshed out, and she has a knack for keeping relationships between people suspenseful (sometimes painfully so). I think the plot itself could have used a little oomph. 
 And there were some secrets revealed that made me cringe and feel for certain characters. I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of Fire now. Overall, I found the book to have a well thought out world and history, with three-dimensional and beautifully flawed characters... a great companion book to Graceling. 
 Oh, and yes, there is Katsa and Po in this one, two of my favorite characters ever. If anything, Bitterblue has inspired me to reread Graceling :)",0
12680907,"I never expected to find such accurate review of this book. I just finished it and funny thing it left me bitter and blue. I can't stress enough how much I agree with you on what you wrote, it soothed my feelings and for that I'm gratefull. The book was so inconsistent. The author showing some parts of plot then setting them aside for another. It was annoying to follow the book as a whole. I also didn't really like the characters. There were times when the author could stop showing some of them and focus on the others. Whereas I usually hate people (I know from earlier work) to act out of character I was really fond of Giddon. The guy stole my heart and I can't seem to shake off the feeling I got in the first half of the book that he and Bitterblue would be a really good match, very Cashore-like if I may add. I was angry with development of Saf's. The book ends without properly ending leaving me frustrated until I start to search for reviews and find out I wasn't the only one sad by ruining potentially good story (it hurts more to see wasted potential than to see a book bad from the start). I was angry the author put a lot of scenes with characters acting out of character. Only Giddon proved it not to be a complete mistake. In his case it wasn't. But there were a lot of characters I liked for themselves and they didn't get enough time in my opinion. Death was very ""sparky"" if I were to say. His every interaction with Queen was priceless. If he'd been any younger I'd also vote for him to be male lead and a partner to the Queen. I didn't think all that much about romance though. Lately I found myself hating any romances but it made me sad that even though Sapphire started out nicely he ended up being... I don't know what, distraction? Reason for Bitterblue's maddness? I can't explain his role at all since it seemed to me that he was just put in few scenes to make things more spicey and to mess with Bitterblue's poor mind even more. The girl was overall stunning in her ability to stay sane even though there was so much happening. I can't shake off the feeling she was the biggest fool in all of this. I could understand of course she was young, protected and there were wiser people plotting against her. Her childhood and heritage not making it any easier for her. Nevertheless her sudden change and impulse to go out into the city was unbelievable. Her trust and actions... It wasn't downright insane and stupid but during the whole book I couldn't stop thinking that it just doesn't feel right. I didn't see much resemblance to Fire though. A lot of you did, and that's probably understandable, but I read Fire long time ago and just recently I finished Graceling. I can't say I was thrilled with it but I liked it, even though I honestly hate Katsa. Reading Bitterblue right after gave me a strange feeling about the characters that appeared in other books before. I don't expect much of Katsa but after 8 years of being together they probably could act a little bit more mature. Although Bitterblue actually made me realise that Katsa is really mentally broken and there's something terribly wrong with her aside from her Grace. Her childhood implies what was wrong but still. One thing lady Cashore is good at is actually making people act very realistically and all the mental issues seem very real. Especially compared with other books where characters just move on without any problems and as if some issues didn't exist at all. They are all damaged by it, and they all struggle to keep their sanity. But just because I understand that and admire reality of it doesn't mean I can stand interactions of Katsa and Po. They just act like kids and there's not much I can say about it, especiallyu when we were getting ANOTHER kissing scene. Good grief... I also didn't like the lenght of the book, it would feel better if it was split into two books, probably giving more room for some parts of the story to be covered more carefully. I'd enjoy story of a Queen realising her own ignorance and inability to be a good ruler without knowing her kingdom inside out but what we got wasn't resembling anything of the sort. It tried in the end, but it wasn't enough for me. Also I can't help thinking all dialouges were cryptic and wrong, people kept asking wrong questions and actually only Giddon was satisfying character. Saf had potential but it was Giddon that felt right the most. I'm glad to read Fire first, then Graceling and then Bitterblue, it made much more sense this way.",0

18333391,"This was the first book I've read by M.S Kaye but it won't be the last. I LOVED Fight Princess. Celisse and Cullen were both well-developed likeable characters who had a lot in common and complimented each other well. Celisse, a former lawyer, comes from a rich family, but she gave that life up and is one of the best fighters in an underground ring. You've got to love a strong girl who has some moves! Cullen is a caring ex-fighter who is accused of murder. Celisse gets involved in the case bringing the two of them together... 
 The murder mystery was well written with lots of twists and turns. The underbelly of the city was well research and vividly came alive with description and fresh writing. Even the villain Ogden was a well-developed and sympathetic character. There aren't many books I've read where I come to feel for the bad guy. I am eagerly awaiting book two in the Full Contact series. There is more to the story and I can't wait to see what happens next.",0

33905854,"New Moon was a perfectly fine read. Maybe it's my recent mood (as previously posted about) that has made enjoying books oddly difficult, but I'm stuck on ""it was fine."" 
 New Moon has excitement, plenty of character depth (though it could use more), and an interesting plot. While I don't believe you *have* to read the prior books to enjoy the story, you probably should. Though, based on my indifference I don't know that I would tell someone to run right out and pick up the series. 
 I'm sad that this ""review"" is so limited, but honestly there wasn't enough of an impact to inspire more. There was nothing specifically wrong, and I hate that I can't really point out pros and cons, but they aren't there (in my mind, I mean).",0
33905854,"The Nero Organization is back, and Antonio Severino wants his prize. Sending his son Sebastian to Reno is the only way to ensure that he will have Lana and her daughter, Sebastian's half-sister and niece. Of course, her mate and son are not needed as they are nothing but wolves. He wants the Reno pack whipped, revenge for his other son's demise. It doesn't matter that Damien was killed by the Reno pack in self-defense, they need to pay for what they have done. And he wants the key to the future of the Nero Organization, the only female's that were born shifters, not bitten. With them, he can breed a whole new breed of shifters, and finally fulfill his goal of domination. 
 Sebastian is the greatest assassin that the Nero Organization has produced. Loyal and obedient, he is the epitome of what Antonio wants to breed. But Antonio has forgotten one thing, Sebastian believes in family, and Antonio has already started severing the ties that bound him to his son. Sending him to kidnap his sister and her daughter without telling him who they were was only one of the many straws that have broken between them. Yet now the circumstances are higher, and the battle will be even more vicious. Not only does Sebastian want to save his sister and her family, but he has finally found his mate and she is right in the middle of the danger. Sebastian will have to use every skill that he has, because if he doesn't defeat his father, not only will he loose the newest members of his family, but his mate as well. 
 NEW MOON is the 8th and final story in Lisa Kessler's Moon series, and it ends with a bang! Sebastian has been the devil incarnate through this whole series, but there is always more to characters than anyone truly sees, and Sebastian is a lie, coated in mystery, and dusted in danger. He has so many different layers, and readers will finally be able to unravel them all to see what is finally underneath. A character of strength and a willingness to fight for what is right, even if he must do wrong things. And Isabelle is just the right type of character to stay by his side, dangerous and strong in her own right. This is a story of redemption and forgiveness and one that I will be going back to re-read numerous times.

33905854,"OK, so I kind of did things a little bit backwards with this series...I started with this story then went and grabbed one and two (the first is free on Amazon now, better get it now before it's gone!). Yes, I know I messed up but that does not mean I can't start from the beginning and read this all over again. This author is new to me and I just loved her writing style, this world, and her characters. I also feel, because the author did such a great job telling this story that it could be read as a standalone. I just finished reading the first book this morning and I am going to start the second one once I'm done here. The conflict with the wolves and the jaguar shifters is pretty heated in this story. I love the game Fate likes to play on these shifters. 
 Sebastian and Isabelle are the main characters in this story. Isabelle Wood is looking for answers, her father had gone missing years ago and she needs to find out why and all her leads point to Nero Org and Sebastian Severino the son to the CEO, Antonio Severino. All believe Sebastian is the ruthless murdering bastard he leads them to see, but deep down he's not even sure which side of the chess board he should be playing on. Will Isabelle avenge her father by killing Sebastian? Is there more to Sebastian then what he leads us to think? If you like your shifters on the dominate side with heart then this is the book for you. You can't go wrong with the action, the lies, the betrayal, and the wonderfully written hot sexy scenes. This was a great ending to a series but also left you some room for a spin-off. 
 ***I voluntarily reviewed this ARC for an honest review via NetGalley, this is my honest opinion and has not been influenced by the author, Publishers or NetGalley in anyway.***",1
33905854,"The truth is somewhere in-between 
 The Nero Organization was created to make super soldiers. Creating Jaguars shifters and a few others. But the CEO, Antonio Severino and father to Sebastian, has made it into something else. Using the organization to further his own goals and agenda. 
 Sebastian is his father's right-hand man. Sebastian tells himself it's to keep his father from doing much worse things. But his agenda is much different from his fathers and yet most don't know this. All believing Sebastian is his father's hammer and that he loves doing it. No one truly knowing which side of the chess board Sebastian is playing on, not even himself some days. 
 Isabelle Wood, daughter of a once high-ranking member of the Nero Org. and mentor to Sebastian, is looking for answers. Trying to find out what happened to her father all the while believing the worse of Sebastian. But when she gets the chance to kill Sebastian, her wolf won't let her finish the job. Instead of needing to protect what belongs to her wolf. 
 This is a story of lies, deceit, betrayals and never knowing for sure who the good guy and who the bad guy really is. 
 Extremely well written and highly entertaining self-contained story to read. You don't want to miss out on this action packed and very enthralling story.",1
33905854,"Wow! What an awesome ending to this series! This book has everything I have come to expect from a Lisa Kessler story - heart, heat, and humor with some suspense and mystery - and not only wraps up the Moon series nicely, but also leaves room for a spin-off. 
 Throughout this series it's been hard to decide how I felt about Sebastian. He's not a nice man, or should I say Jaguar shifter, but knowing he's the product of his father's manipulations has always made me think twice before just wishing Adam would take him out. He's helped the pack but he's also hurt them. And I loved how the author has given Sebastian a shot at redemption. 
 Isabelle was the perfect match for Sebastian. She's fierce and determined and not about to let Sebastian dictate the terms of their relationship - either professional or personal. She has to come to terms with the fact that he is her mate, which has posed all sorts of problems for Isabelle since she blames him for her father's death and knows the evil that he is associated with. 
 With things coming to a head these two really didn't have time for a proper romance. Sebastian is right in the middle of everything going down, so their relationship is formed in the trust that they need to have in each other for the upcoming battle - trust that is hard to give to someone who you have always seen as the enemy. So those moments when Isabelle and Sebastian connect are even more meaningful. Isabelle sees beyond the mask that Sebastian wears which makes him want more. Their romance was raw and rough, but also very intense since there's a good chance that one or both of them might not come out of things alive. 
 I loved that previous characters were brought in and loved everything about Adam's role in this book. He's always been such an awesome alpha to the Reno pack and it was great to see him take charge and make decisions which seemed questionable but truly had the strength and security of the pack in mind. It was great seeing the Reno and Sedona packs come together and finally taking a stand against Nero. 
 Although this is the last book in the series, it can be read as a stand-alone since the author does a good job filling in any necessary gaps. Of course for the best effect I would recommend starting at the beginning and getting to meet all the pack. 
 Well done, Lisa Kessler - and thank you for sharing your world with us. This has been one of my favorite series that I would definitely recommend to anyone who loves wolves and shifters.

6391265,"Beware the blurb! Whichever wily marketeer decided to compare Plascencia with Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Italo Calvino did the writer no favours. A cloying mix of magic realism and metafiction, which suggests in turn the name-checked writers at their worst, the result is strangely soulless and the first 100 pages feel something of a chore. 
 The author has talent but as a first novel 'The People of Paper' tries hard to impress and the addition of the kitchen sink- one full of washing water- leads to the ickle cut-outs turning to mush. So many voices compete and yet they all sound the same. And the number of gimmicks in the book made me shudder remembering that 'Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close' debacle. 
 Thankfully I stuck around and when the meta-fiction really kicks in there is some heart delivered into the proceedings- the transplant The People of Paper needs. 
 I'd like to read a later and more mature work but this seems to be the only thing Plascencia has come up with, solus. Papercuts?",15
23754581,"This is an odd little book that doesn't conform to any definition. It has an air of fairy tale about it, but then there are security men talking into their wrists and people wearing casual attire. The character of the king could be a metaphor for any number of dictators - he's basically just evil and arbitrary and gluttonous, so maybe he's supposed to represent all that's bad in politics. You're left to draw your own conclusions. The story is simply told without much embellishment. It follows a straight course from beginning to end without giving much analysis of the protagonist. Again, you're left to draw your own conclusions about his character and how he feels about his plan. 
 I didn't engage emotionally with the story - the descriptions are a little too detached and the characters didn't interest me much. However, the author definitely has talent, and this is a fun little diversion, well paced and plotted. The author provided a review copy, and I will happily read his work because I was very impressed with his stories in his book Abandoned.",0
23754581,"This is a charming story told from a unique point of view, that of a royal food taster. In the beginning I thought I was reading something written like a fairy tale, but it soon became clear that it was a very modern monarchy. The author's use of language to create the detail of this one-of-a-kind modern fairy tale kingdom was brilliant! Descriptions of modern security guards, similar to Secret Service agents, blended seamlessly with images reminiscent of childhood fairly tales (the cabbage man, the king's obsequious entourage, etc.) to form something truly unique. 
 It didn't take me long to agree that the power-obsessed, narcissistic king needed to die, for reasons not nearly as noble as those of the royal food taster. I wasn't prepared, though, for all of the twists and turns. Each was as unexpected as perfectly plausible. 
 This story is a quick and delightful read. I highly recommend it. The language was so delicious that I read it twice!

23754581,"Review copy provided by the author. 
 There's a nice wry humour in this occasionally grim novella about the King's official food taster, a man who's also part of a conspiracy to kill the king. Heskett builds up the tension well, and in the short time he allows himself, describes a small world where everything revolves around the whim of a particularly unpleasant king, a man unaware of everyone else's dislike of him, from family members to foreign visitors, but also extremely concerned that no one poisons him. It turns out that's the least of his troubles. 
 The world includes CIA-type security guards, extravagant meals, a palace bereft of its former treasures, and a bunch of servants living in fear of their lives. 
 It's a quick read, but one that holds your attention from beginning to end.",2
3821360,"This book reviews the evidence for the various main forms of alternative medicine. The take-home message, for me, was that most of these treatments are completely ineffective but harmless, with two major exceptions. 
 First is herbal medicines, which are largely untested but some of which work. Of course they can also have just as bad side-effects as anything your doctor will prescribe for you, and there's no guarantee of the quality of the product. So that's a bit of a crap-shoot. 
 And the surprisingly scary one is chiropractic. It turns out your chiropractor can kill you! Who knew. 
 A study found that 'patients under forty-five years of age who had suffered torn arteries [in their neck:] were five times more likely to have visited a chiropractor in the week prior to the damage being recognised than healthy individuals of a similar age.' And the torn artery then gives you a stroke. 
 Anyway, it's interesting stuff, if occasionally bit dry, since inevitably a lot of the time it is reporting data from studies.",0

This should be required reading for everyone who's even thinking of going the alternative route.",0

 I'd call this book a reinforcement of common sense,and it deserves credit for being one that NEEDED to have been written. As you get from one page to the next, you'll be thanking yourself for picking it up. For heaven knows the sea of 'alternative' therapies we're surrounded by today. 
 Strangely, this book impressed me so much by defying all the ways I would have expected it to be written. 
 -First of all, there are no sensational accusations, mud-hurling or alarmist warnings at the very outset. The chapters on each therapy follow the clean, systematic build-up that the authors advocate all through, giving you a very clear understanding and insight of what goes into a clinical trial. 
 -Secondly, the book is clean of any satire. Your health is a serious subject, it is addressed seriously. Period. However, the issue of alternative medicine so pervades the life of the common man that one can't but read the lines with one's own personal satirical goggles. 
 This is the sort of book you want to kiss, that leaves you a little bit enraged yet releived. The authors ensure that their point is well understood and clearly conveyed, the information is presented with a view of genuine social responsibility.They go out of their way not just to present scientific evidence , but to demonstrate the relevance,indispensibility and foolproof architecture of the scientific method of investiation. 
 Now if you think this is a tome toting laws and drab facts and figures, you couldn't be more wrong. Not that it should matter, but the text is replete with historical and recent anecdotes- ranging from intriguing, disconcerting to plain shocking. And for a book about clinical test procedures, regulating bodies and phoney practitioners, it is also miraculously- whats the word?- compassionate. 
 Do yourself a favour, read this book. 
 Either way, if you choose not to and just take my word for it, here's some lines from the last chapter that made me want to cheer on the final climax. 
 ""Alternative therapists use the term 'alternative'to promote that they somehow exploit alternative aspects of science.The truth, however, is that there is no such thing as alternative science, just as there is no alternative biology, alternative anatomy, alternative testing or alternative evidence. The term 'alternative' is merely an attempt to escape from the truth by replacing knowledge derived from science by hunches derived from intuition, anecdote and tradition...""",0
3821360,"Trick or Treatment didn't have to carry me very far, I was already severely dubious of any from of alternative medicine, and it may in fact have made me reconsider my own point of view on a number of the treatments that apparently have some claim to efficacy, despite the authors' overwhelmingly negative conclusions with regards to the efficacy of alternative treatments. 
 However, I don't know whether I really appreciated its overall tone, which, while informative, struck me as too impassioned to be as neutral as they claimed to be. I agreed with their arguments, and I too was shocked and outraged when they presented the evidence and theory behind some of these treatments, homeopathy in particular. Unfortunately I don't think their arguments will be nearly as convincing when faced with someone who has a vested interested, or even a strong belief, in the treatments they describe. A lighter touch would probably be more convincing, and might have made it a slightly easier read. 
 That said, I came out of this book feeling significantly more knowledgable on the subject than I was when I started. The references that I followed up on proved solid and intriguing, which leads me to believe that the authors' position is both well researched and dependable. I thought it was interesting that one of the authors, Edzard Ernst, is an expert in the field of Complementary and Alternative medecine, and has even practiced homeopathy. 
 I should note that the book is written from a British perspective, and that all of the references to healthcare, costs, etc... are in pounds and the context of the NHS. I didn't mind this, as Canada's healthcare system seems fairly close to the UK system, and the majority of the information the book provides is location agnostic.",2
25142942,"Great from start to finish. Make sure you read the end matter, including the author interview. 
 Some other reviewers take issue with the author being white, that this is not his story to tell. Being white myself, I don't know how much validity my voice would add to an argument on either side of that. 
 However in general, it seems like any time you take on telling someone else's story it's risky. You have to do your research for sure and work really hard to be true to the experiences of your subjects. To me, this seemed well done in Lovecraft Country. I'm really interested to hear reviews from people who might say this IS their story to tell.",0
25142942,"My short review of this is: Cthulhu ain't got nothing on a mid-century white man when it comes to creating terror. This is a really great book of interconnecting stories about a black family in Chicago in 1953, and how they have to deal with both supernatural horrors and Jim Crow (yes, in the North--Ruff smartly makes sure we know all of this is happening in the North). Extremely fun.",0
25142942,"Superb blending off Lovecraft and the Jim Crow era 
 A truly superb work of fiction. It has all the Lovecraftian themes one could hope for, a lot of occult societies that perfectly mimic real life ones, in behavior of not in abilities, and paints a perfect picture of the period in time when blacks were legally and officially treated as second class citizens. It is both tongue in cheek and serious. It has pathos. 
 The story progress in vignettes, but they all tie in to the overall narrative seamlessly. There's neither a boring vignette, nor one that doesn't perfectly move the story along. Character development is fantastic with the possible exception of Ruby, who comes across a bit too one dimensional. 
 The villains, especially the main one, are understandable, and probably not villainous in their own eyes. They simply have goals that may not be shared by the protagonists, and a total disregard for others' rights, which again is logical considering that civil rights were still far in the future. 
 The use of an Adamic language is a nice touch, and reminiscent of Enochian, an actual ""received"" angelic language channeled centuries ago by John Dee and Edward Kelly, and reputed to be the language of creation. Many of the themes regarding the occult have obviously been researched carefully, and of course tweaked with fine poetic license.

31372908,"I was sent a copy of the novel by the author in return for an honest review. 
 With nods to film classics It's a Wonderful Life and Ghost, Colette McCormick's debut is a light fantasy romance which follows Ellen Reed coming to terms with her premature death. Caught somewhere between the living and The Other Side (Heaven, if you're a believer in Christian theory), Ellen is accompanied by George, her novice Guide (an angel, ditto earlier) who helps her to tie up loose ends with her remaining family - her six-year-old daughter, her husband and her difficult mother - and steers her towards acceptance of her state. There are no spoilers here as we are told this almost from the outset. 
 If this makes it sound a little depressing, it really, really isn't. If anything it's the opposite: life affirming. There are moments of humour and joy as well as sadness and if you enjoy gentle family dramas then you should enjoy this. McCormick is at her strongest in the depiction of domestic detail and parenthood. Touching moments include Ellen's laughter as she observes husband Marc struggling to wrap Christmas presents and sadness when he finally clears away her possessions and discovers the usual flim-flam hidden in women's underwear drawers: the plastic wristbands strapped to infants in maternity units, pressed flowers and wedding invitations. McCormick has a keen eye for such detail and such observations will have many readers nodding in acknowledgement. The leads are likeable and McCormick clearly holds great affection for all her characters. 
 This is a gentle, warm-hearted read and it is as comforting as chicken broth on a cold afternoon.",2

25366765,"After reading Mardan's Mark, I wasn't sure how Healer's Curse could compete. The novella follows the events that are happening at home during the events of Book 1. I wasn't disappointed. I could see how this novella was setting things up for book 2, but it also managed to be it's own story. Elilan was strong like Srilani, but also vulnerable and I couldn't help but root for her. And the main guy? Well, he gave Aldan a run for his money. I'm really looking forward to seeing all these characters together in the next book! 
 I was given a copy of Healer's Curse in exchange for my honest review/recommendation",0
25366765,"I had the honor and pleasure of reading an electronic advance copy of Healer's Curse by Kathrese McKee. Healer's Curse is a novella in her Mardan's Mark Series. The novella is a cute romantic fantasy set in northern half of the twin kingdoms, which rather reminds me of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, transplanted to the south near the gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi river, all re-named. The novella's back story appears to be events from the first novel in the series, and I suspect the heroine is a minor character in that tale. If so, that makes this all the more interesting. I found the back story references raise reader interest in the larger series without being too intrusive. 
 The heroine of Healer's Curse is medieval doctor, Lady Elilan, only eighteen-years-old and already a widow, whose late husband has died after only a year of marriage. To make the tragedy greater for her, she was already an orphan, her husband was a dear childhood friend, and she has a supernatural gift of healing, which she'd attempted to use with her husband to no avail. This naturally brings guilt and confusion as she asks what many believers ask, why didn't God heal him? On top of it, gossipy neighbors have rather cruel opinions on the matter, thinking she caused or allowed her husband's death. She becomes afraid to use her gift at all, which is only further cemented when she attempts it again with her ailing mother-in-law and again El (God) doesn't allow the healing and her mother-in-law dies. 
 The romantic element is when she finds herself treating a soldier from the southern kingdom, which adds further conflict since there is friction between the two kingdoms, with many northerners wanting a total separation, and she has many separatists in her family. Though she does a really good job of resisting those influences and treating all patients fairly in my reading. It is much harder for her to maintain her professional distance from her patient. 
 The novella Healer's Curse has good themes on bridging differences, the intersection faith and healing and tragedy. The voice has a lovely quality, perfectly suited to the first person narrator being a healer. If you enjoy Fantasy that is light on magic and light on violence and transports medieval worlds to maps closer to home (for Americans anyway), this will be a heart-warming, heart-soothing treat.",0
25366765,"I got this e-ARC in exchange for an honest review. 
 When I heard that this book would be released before the second book in the series, I was disappointed. But after reading it, I am glad that the author had taken the time to write it. At the end of Mardan's Mark, I had 2 thoughts. One was that it would have been better with a map of the realm included in the book and the other was that it could have included tidings of happenings at the palace in the absence of the Princesses and the Prince. The author, Kathrese McKee must be a mind reader because that's what this novella is about. 
 The blurb is rather short but it sums up the story very well. We are introduced to new characters like Elilan and Raymon while we reacquaint ourselves with a few known ones like Judge Elison and Greyson etc., While Srilani and others are struggling to head back home, we get to know Elilan, to whom Renee was apprenticed. I think the look given to Elilan in the book cover is quite right. She is a gentle waif but who has a backbone of steel and a quirky sense of humour while Raymon is most times serious and sometimes roguish, Both are stubborn in their own way and their story is more the enjoyable for it. There are other characters coming and going and they all form the details of the book. We become more familiar with the Royalty families of Northern and Southern Marst. The plot is straight forward enough with just a twist or two thrown in. The romantic element forms the major part of the story this time with just a little bit of action added to spice it up. It's a good continuation to the series and I am most eagerly waiting to get my hands on the next book. 
 *Sighs* I have to wait some more to read about Srilani and Elilan and others but you don't have to, if you want to try out the series. Grab Mardan's Mark and get introduced to a good session of fantasy. 
 My one line review : Greater part romance and lesser part action makes Healer's Curse a good sequel!

I enjoyed this novella and would read more by Ms. McKee. She is a skilled writer and I imagine that had I read Mardan's Mark, I may have enjoyed this story even more. However, my rating of four stars just goes to show you that Healer's Curse also makes a good stand-alone that is well worth the time.",1
17665483,"I just finished reading A Goddess Curse. I loved how the author placed the Goddess Hera in modern times, returning to earth after a very long self exile. Having her interviewed by a typical daytime chat fest show show host on a typical daytime talk show was a clever setting. The setting allowed Hera to be questioned about her history as a petty vengeful shrew and gave her the chance to set the record straight, which she does. It was particularly interesting how she compared the gods history of petty squabbles amongst themselves with current events going on in the world today, from politics to war around the world. This short story was a very clever way to make readers give some thought to that old addage: 'The more things change, the more things stay the same'. I felt the author, Luciana Cavallaro, ended her short story on a fairly upbeat note when Hera tells her host that we're not doing so bad, despite how things may seem. I highly recommend this short story to everyone.",1
17665483,"An inventive and engaging short story that looks at ancient history through the lens of our modern love of spectacle -- in this case a television talk show. In A Goddess' Curse, author Luciana Cavallaro (@ClucianaLuciana) has once again found an interesting way to re-examine characters from classic literature, in this case Hera, the most powerful goddess on Mount Olympus and wife of Zeus. 
 My review is based on a copy of the story provided by the author for that purpose. 
 As Ms. Cavallaro did with the conversations between Helen and the historian in The Curse of Troy (my review), the concept of being on the talk show of host Drake Dabbler allows Hera to both explain and defend her actions, which earned her a reputation as vengeful and extremely jealous. The story moves quickly with the high points of Hera's life touched on in her often contentious banter with Dabbler, but those unfamiliar with the mythology will still enjoy the ride and likely will end up with the urge to delve deeper into Hera's life. 
 In fact, this would make an excellent addition to a high-school literature class, with the very modern elements serving to whet the appetite to learn more of the historical record. 
 There is a bit of a twist at the end, which savvy readers may sense is coming. For my part, a college class decades ago taught me it is unwise to get too comfortable when dealing with Greek gods and goddesses. 
 More years ago than I care to remember, I attended Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois. I didn't graduate from the small, private, horrendously-expensive-even-then, liberal-arts college -- not even close. But I did manage to take a world literature class taught by the late Dorothy Parkander, who, to me, will forever be the perfect model of an English professor: smart, articulate, biting in the face of foolishness but warm and nurturing to a fault when helping students realize the wonders of the word. 
 As one of the 40,000 students she taught at the college once said: ""to attend Augustana sans a Dorothy Parkander course is to eat a meal without an entree or stay only for a play's intermission."" An unfocused underachiever during my first go-round at higher education, I consider the B+ received from Professor Parkander in that class, in which we studied Homer's Odyssey, among my top achievements. 
 While reading A Goddess' Curse, I believe on more than one occasion I heard echoes of Professor Parkander as she described the meaning of ""hubris."" :)",1
35062852,"The moment I read the opening line of the first story in this collection (from ""Chocolate Surprise"" by E. Kaiser Writes) -- ""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman, in possession of any income at all, must be in want of some chocolate."" -- I knew I was going to have the best time reading these stories. I was right. ^_^ 
 From the lovely introduction right through each of these nine tales to the end of the collection, I was touched and charmed and smiling (or laughing), and overall delighting in finding these sweet gems, retelling or otherwise revisiting Jane Austen's tales in many different colorful ways. 
 We have four set in modern times, two in the original time period (like a direct prequel and sequel), one in the 1950s, one non-magical fantasy, one kingdom adventure, and even a sci-fi story! Three involve Emma, two Pride and Prejudice, two Mansfield Park, and one each of Persuasion and Sense and Sensibility. I enjoyed them all! 
 Below are my mini-thoughts on each entry. Second Impressions (I love the play on titles, harking back to Pride and Prejudice's early title ""First Impressions""!) is a lovely add-on to the Vintage Jane Austen series. One thing is for sure: if you like Jane Austen's works at all, you're going to want to give these stories a try! :) 
 Introduction - Hannah Scheele 
 5 stars 
 Hannah collected a varied and sweet bunch of stories in the contest for this collection, designed absolutely gorgeous covers for the Vintage Jane Austen series, and wrote a delightful introduction too! This was a lovely introduction, full of heart and honesty and a touch of wit; perfect for the collection. I read it twice, before and after reading the stories. It made me happy. ^_^ 
 Chocolate Surprise - E. Kaiser Writes 
 5 stars 
 At the beginning, I wasn't totally sure which retelling this was, or if I'd like it, but pretty soon everything clicked and I was like ""OH!"" and the pieces fell together. And I loved the end! I also loved the letter, and Kingston was great. :D It's set in the 1950s, and the color and detail was fabulous and so vivid. I shall allow you to discover the story it retells, yourself, but overall I really enjoyed it! :) 
 Gently Pursued, Finally Persuaded - Gail Bryant 
 5 stars 
 Aww, so sweet! :) A Contemporary retelling of Persuasion, set in the 1990s, this was an unconventional love story, with a Christian theme and a thread of humor. It said this was the author's first short story, but you would never have known it! The writing was well seasoned and full of clever or fun turns of phrases scattered throughout. The story left me with a smile. ^_^ Lovely! 
 The Secret of Pemberly Estate - Therese Peyton 
 4 stars 
 I wasn't so sure about this one. It's a direct sort of sequel to Pride and Prejudice, set in 1815. I had just re-read Pride and Prejudice, and some of the characters in this story seemed to act out of character, to me at least, and some of the plot confused me. It was, however, very original/thrilling/theatrical, like a mystery. Not my favorite, but it did have vivid imagery and was an interesting read. :) 
 Emma's Irritation - Mikayla Holman 
 5 stars 
 Eep, I loved this one! It's a sort of prequel, set a few years before Emma, and features a teenage Emma and her relationship with Mr. Knightley, as well as some scenes fans of Emma will find intriguing and fun. Mr. Knightley felt very Mr. Knightley ish! He was great. And I could imagine Emma herself being something like that as a teen. I loved the bantering dialog and fun! And just... really enjoyed it. :) 
 Mother's Day - Jennifer Baxter 
 5 stars 
 Aww! ^_^ I can't really explain this one without giving it away, somehow, but it was an extremely unique and touching twist on a Sense and Sensibility story in a modern setting. It's very short, but every word counts, and just... I don't know! It was subtle but just lovely. :) 
 The Mansfield - E. Kaiser Writes 
 5 stars 
 OH MY GOODNESS. This story! I never would have imagined Jane Austen in space would work as well as this did. The idea of Mansfield Park's story taking place on a spaceship (instead of in a mansion) was genius and worked astonishingly well. The characters and dialog were great (the worldbuilding too) and the Mansfield Park story translated SO well to this new in-space setting that it was just delightful! :) I don't even read much sci-fi but this was great. XD 
 Elaina - Hannah Jones 
 5 stars 
 I was trying to categorize this, and I think I came up with Christian Fiction and the newly named Kingdom-Adventure genre. (There wasn't really adventure? But hey.) This retelling of Emma set in a kingdom of knights. etc., and featuring her as a princess, was so neat! Again, it translated really well, and I thought that was great fun. :) Amazing how well a little kingdom works to replace Emma's small town! 
 Peace in the Orchard - E. Kaiser Writes 
 5 stars 
 Imagine Pride and Prejudice set in an idyllic, non-magical, fantasy-type kingdom where Mr. Darcy is a dragon-slaying king, and you pretty much have this one in a nutshell. XD There's a lot of lovely description of this original, fantastic world, and it mainly focuses on the Elizabeth and Jane characters. The orchard scene at the end was my favorite. :) 
 Maid in Houston - Jennifer Baxter 
 4 stars 
 This was a Contemporary retelling of Mansfield Park, featuring a Hispanic heroine -- who I quite liked -- and a modern setting in Houston. It was a little strange to me, but had some lovely parts and overall it was a very good retelling of Mansfield Park, and so fluidly written and original! It's about every-day people, and I loved that. The part at the end about love was beautiful. ^_^ 
 OVERALL: 
 What an absolutely sweet (and varied!) collection of retellings! I absolutely loved these little tales -- all so unique, and either funny, touching, or just plain enjoyable. ^_^ Some are modern, others historical, or with a dash of kingdoms/light fantasy, and even a sci-fi story! Lovely Jane-Austen-esque gems by talented authors, this collection of stories is a wonderful addition to the Vintage Jane Austen series, and if you're an Austen fan, you definitely need to give this sweet bundle of tales a try. Excuse me while I hug it.

22738140,"No Test For The Wicked is the fifth book in the Lexi Carmichael mystery/romance series. It is extremely well written and professionally edited. 
 High school wasn't good for Lexi, cyber investigator, the first time around and when she has to pose as a high school student to investigate hackers at a prestigious private school the second time isn't much better. Especially when the terrorists show up. 
 I love Lexi's character and watching my favorite nerd girl growing as a person. In fact, the funniest and loveliest moments in this book are when she is feeling her way through her interactions with others. I was a little disappointed at the lack of appearance of some of the secondary characters. The break with Finn has been glossed over in the last two books, which really doesn't fit in with his Lexi obsessed and strong willed character in earlier books. 
 The plot was suspense filled and fast paced. It was a believable scenario and I love how it paralleled current events. The ending was poignant, but filled with hope, so I guess I would qualify it as a HFN. 
 I am a major Lexi Carmichael fan girl and I highly recommend this book and series.

 REVIEW 
 This is a very cute and well written book about a Monkey who deals with bullies. 
 Monica is left all alone after her good friend has gone away for the day and she decides to go to Monkey Beach. The reason she doesn't like to go there is the other Monkeys have always made fun of her for being smaller and different. 
 See Monkey prefers to live in the jungle with her animal friends and the other monkeys find that strange. 
 While playing in the water she over hears the other monkeys making fun of her and it hurts Monica's feelings. 
 Then Monica over hears a bunch of noise and then they are all trapped by a hunter in a net. But Monica is not to worried because although her friends are much larger she is small which means she can get out and go for help . 
 Moral of the story. Just because you are different does not mean you are not perfect.

9542800,"The death drive is the will to repeat a motion, even at the expense of life. There is no other course here, than to perform the material motion, regardless of its outcome. 
 Cute bunnies juxtapose against the purely mechanical and impersonal, even if that action is the senseless repetition of humans in pursuit of innocent and inane desires. 
 This is how our world is characterized; as a cold mechanical repetition of drive, given endless permission to do its own thing. Because as producers or consumers, our actions and desires only exist as a cut up narrative, without hook into the larger production of life. The military-industrial complex is too big for anyone to comprehend. Its logistics cannot be captured in anything except abstractly as a balance sheet. Its bureaucratic organization is made only to repeat narrow channels of action. Dawn of the Bunny Suicides expresses this capitalist-industrial sentiment when we begin to notice only the here and now, as our organic experience of life; our lifeworld is split, cut and presented as a series of present moments only, in which there is nothing but repetition of desire and mechanical to-do motion.",0

A few of the characters got the comeuppance that I have always wished they had gotten!",0
26832227,"I will start with praises. 
 I think Nicole Clarkston feels Austen's world (at least from P&P) quite perfectly. I have read a few P&P variations, and I had not found an author who would create so believable story. First of all, Clarkston was very loyal to the original characters of P&P (at least for the most part - more below). Darcy was Darcy [I honestly think that even drunk Darcy was believable, and I loved this scene], Mr. Collins was Mr. Collins, Jane was Jane and so on. And I really mean it. There are so many P&P variations whose authors didn't bother with much loyalty. And I want to stress it out: Nicole Clarkston did a really good job here. 
 Next, what is also very important, she invented very smartly how to retell the story. I think that most writers choose the moment after the first proposal. Here, the novel started after the Netherfield ball and I really liked how Elizabeth and Darcy worked on with their misunderstandings and prejudices. 
 Now we touch the weak points of the book. 
 Elizabeth and Darcy were finding their love and understanding really slow. I loved their encounters but between them, I sometimes drowned in their thoughts, and I mean it in the wrong way. I was sometimes simply bored. Mrs. Clarkston caught their minds perfectly but she shouldn't have written so much of them, especially that they were repeating themselves. 
 Unfortunately, near the end of the book, there were plot twists (what became of Anne de Bourgh, Caroline Bingley and Charlotte Lucas) and scenes (e.g. the kissing), that I found less believable. 
 So, I started to read it with small expectations, then I thought I had found a gem, but with time, there appeared smaller and bigger flaws. Therefore the paragraphs of the last chapters I was often skipping. 
 This book had a potential for a five-star variation of P&P. But it should have been shorter and some plots should have been rethought.",0

 A la recherche d'une serie francaise qui pourrait approximer les profondeurs de la serie Animorphs #1-54 - comme divertissement, mais aussi pour mon memoire ce semestre - j'ai ecoute les conseils d'une amie et pris ce livre dans mes mains. Une semaine plus tard, je l'ai lu du debut jusqu'a la fin. Pourquoi est-ce qu'il m'a pris une semaine ? N'etait-ce pas assez interessant ? Mais oui c'etait forte interessent, mais j'ai du faire des devoirs et assister a mes cours ! 
 Ou commencer avec ce commentaire, c'est ca la vrai question... Ici on a l'histoire d'une jeune fille, Camille, qui un jour se trouve dans un monde parallele au notre, le temps de ramasser une pierre magique, se faire reparer par un monstre, et par consequence aider un chevalier echapper a la mort, avant de se retrouver de nouveau dans notre monde. Mais ce << grand pas sur le cote >> qu'elle vient de faire va ouvrir une porte sur un monde de la magie, des chevaliers, des monstres, des Dessins et de l'Imaginaire. Avec son meilleur ami Salim, ils vont tous les deux se retrouver de nouveau dans ce monde magnifique et bizarre, ou des amis et des ennemis leur attendent. 
 Camille est une fille surdouee en intelligence, et en puissance magique. Ses parents adoptifs sont riches, mais ils ne semblent pas vraiment aimer leur fille adoptif, donc elle se refugie souvent dans la bibliotheque ou en passant du temps avec sa meilleur ami Salim. Salim est un homme d'une intelligence normale, mais de tres bonne humeur et acrobatique. Quant a lui, autant que les parents de Camille demandent qu'elle revienne a la maison avant dix-huit heures chaque soir et meme si elle n'a que 10 minutes de retard ils la reprimandent, les parents et les freres et soeurs de Salim ne lui pretent presque jamais beaucoup d'attention sauf quand ses freres et soeurs essaient de l'embeter. Pour Salim, son refuge est sur le balcon de son batiment HLM, dans une espace qu'il a cree pour lui-meme et que sa famille connait tres bien d'etre une zone interdite. 
 Comme je lis beaucoup de la fantaisie et science-fiction, je n'ai pas vraiment trouve beaucoup les intrigues completement originaux - Camille est essentiellement un << special snowflake >> (ayant des avantages exceptionnels) surdouee en intelligence et en pouvoirs magique et en savoir-faire de ces dons (or, elle apprend tres, tres vite comment s'en servir), et Salim est son compagnon fidele, qui la fait rire, qui la soutient, qui donnerait tout pour l'aider, et meme est visiblement amoureux d'elle . Camille n'a aucune souvenir avant ses sept ans ni de ses parents biologique, mais des son deuxieme arrivee en Gwendalavir, elle et Salim rencontrent bientot une des plus grands heros de l'autre monde, puis pleins d'autres gens tres importantes dans le royaume. Ils ont beaucoup de la chance avec ces rencontres, et memes quand ils rencontrent des Ts'liches ou autres ennemis. 
 Il y avait aussi quelques petits manques de coherence, par exemple le chien qui etait << manifestement blesse >> (page 41) mais une semaine plus tard, est deja au retour de son boulot comme chien de garde. Aussi, il y cet echange : 
 -- Les reveurs ? interrogea Camille. 
 -- Oui. Dans ton monde, on les appellerait certainement moins ou pretres. [...] 
 -page 183 
 Celui qui repond a Camille n'est probablement jamais alle dans son monde, dont je ne comprends pas comment il pourrait faire cette reference pour lui expliquer qui sont les reveurs... au moins qu'on n'apprend pas dans les tomes a venir qu'il est deja voyager a notre monde. 
 Par contre, les autres habitants inhumain et humain de l'autre monde et Gwendalavir sont assez originaux, et chacun entre eux a sa propre motivation et culture. Les Sentinelles, les Ts'liches, les marcheurs, les rais, les siffleurs, les coureurs...j'aimerais savoir plus sur les marchombres surtout, comme ils sont des voleurs d'une souplesse et rapidite exceptionnelle - et comme Salim s'interessent par eux et leurs capacites, aussi ! 
 Neanmoins, 
 je me suis bien amusee avec ce livre : autant que Salim fait rire Camille, il m'a fait rire aussi - son sens d'humeur est superbe, et il comprend plutot bien que mal comment diffuser une situation ou au moins inserer un peu d'humeur dans la situation. En plus, j'ai vu des petits indices qu'on peut comprendre beaucoup plus de ce livre que ce qui apparaisse a la surface : a la page 22, l'auteur P. Bottero nous introduire brievement au racisme et sexisme, et comment Salim fait front a ces attitudes. M. Bottero adresse aussi des stereotypes de la vie (par exemple, l'idee que << l'eleve ideal n'etait pas un eleve intelligent, mais un eleve travailleur, calme et obeissant >> a la page 46), comment trouver plus ou moins toujours le bien dans une mauvaise situation, comment pouvoir se moquer de soi-meme avec de la bonne humeur, l'importance des amis qu'on choisit (on pourrait dire aussi, comment pour certains, la famille qu'ils creent en choisissant des amis pourraient etre plus important que la famille adoptif ou meme biologique), comment briser le quatrieme mur de l'ouvrage avec quelques phrases de Salim et de Camille, et meme l'auteur insere des indices de ce qui va venir : les jeunes seront obliges de vieillir plus tot que tard. 
 Un passage qui m'a touche au coeur etait avec le clochard qui n'aimerait que de pouvoir lire encore une fois dans sa vie - pour moi, pouvoir lire est une des choses a laquelle je me tiens tres fort, que j'espere ne jamais devoir renoncer. 
 En bref, meme si j'ai trouve pas mal des tropes classiques dans ce livre, quand meme il m'a amuse beaucoup, et j'ai hate de lire la suite. Il y a beaucoup plus a apprendre a Gwendalavir, et l'aventure, le danger, les amities, ne font que commencer. 
 English review 
 In my search for a French series which could approximate the depths of the Animorphs #1-54 - for leisure, but as well for the thesis I have to write this semester - I heeded the advice of a friend and picked up this book. One week later, I had read it from cover to cover. Why did it take me a full week? Was it not interesting enough? On the contrary it was very interesting, but I had homework to do and classes to attend, too! 
 Where to start with this review, that is the real question... Here we have the story of a young girl, Camille, who one day finds herself in a world parallel to our own. She just has time to pick up a magic stone, get noticed by a monster, and as a result help a knight escape death before finding herself once again in our world. But this ""big step to the side"" which she has just achieved will open up a door to magic, to knights, to monsters, to Drawings and the Imagination. With her best friend Salim, they will together find themselves once again in this magnificent and strange world, where friends and enemies alike await them. 
 Camille is a young girl who is extremely gifted in intelligence, and in magical powers. Her adoptive parents are rich, but they do not seem to really love their adoptive daughter, so she often seeks refuge in the library or in spending time with her best friend Salim. Salim is a boy of normal intelligence, but a great sense of humor and he is also very acrobatic. As much as Camille's parents require that she be home before 6pm each night and lecture her if she is even 10 minutes late, Salim's parents and siblings hardly ever pay him much mind except for when his siblings try to bother him. For Salim, his refuge is on the balcony of his low-income apartment building, in an area he created for himself and that his family knows is off-limits. 
 As I read a lot of fantasy and science fiction, I didn't really find the plot completely original - Camille is essentially a Special Snowflake, with her great intelligence and her strong magical powers and how to use them (admittedly, she learned very, very quickly how to make use of them), and Salim is her loyal traveling companion who makes her laugh, who supports her, who would give everything to help her, and is even obviously in love with her, . Camille doesn't have any memories before she was seven years old nor of her biological parents, but soon after her second trip to Gwendalavir, her and Salim soon meet one of the greatest heroes of this other world, and other very important people in the kingdom. They have a lot of good luck in these meetings, and even when they encounter Ts'liches or other enemies. 
 There were also a few inconsitencies, for example the dog who was ""clearly hurt"" (page 41) but one week later he was already back to his job as a guard dog. Also, there was this exchange: 
 -- The Dreamers ? questioned Camille. 
 -- Yes. In your world, they would certainly be called monks or priests. [...] 
 -page 183 
 The character who answers Camille has probably never been to our world, so I don't get how he could make this reference to explain who the Dreamers are to Camille... unless it's only in one of the later books that we will learn that he has already traveled to our world. 
 On the other hand, the other human and inhuman inhabitants of the other world and Gwendalavir are quite original, and each of them has his or her own motivation and culture. The Sentinels, the Ts'liches, the walkers (marcheurs), the rais, the whistlers (siffleurs), the runners (coureurs)... I would like to know more about the marchombres (walking men) most of all, as they are thieves of exceptional flexibility and speed - and seeing as Salim is interested by them and their abilities, too! 
 Nevertheless, 
 I thoroughly enjoyed myself with this book: as much as Salim makes Camille laugh, he made me laugh too - his sense of humor is great, and he understands better than most how to diffuse a tense situation or at least inject a situation with a bit of humor. What's more, I found several little indications that we can delve deeper into this book than is apparent on the surface: on page 22, the author P. Bottero briefly introduces us to the themes of racism and sexism, and how Salim faces up to these attitudes. Bottero also addresses life stereotypes (such as the idea that ""the ideal student is not an intelligent one, but a hard-working one who is calm and obeys"" on page 46), how to find more or less always the good in a bad situation, how to laugh at yourself in good humor, the importance of the friends we choose (we could also say, how for some people, the family that they create by their choice of friends can be more important than an adoptive family or even biological family), how to break the fourth wall of a book through several utterances by Salim and Camille, and the author even adds in some little clues about what is to come: the youths will be forced to grow up sooner rather than later. 
 One section which really got to me was with the homeless man who wanted nothing more in his life than to be able to read once again - for me, being able to read a physical book is one of the things which I hold most dear, and I hope I never have to give it up. 
 In brief, even if I noticed quite a few classic tropes in this book, it still amused me greatly, and I can't wait to read the next one. There is so much more to learn in Gwendalavir, and the adventure, danger, friendships are only just beginning.

 J'avais lu et adore la trilogie quand elle est sortie il y a une dizaines d'annee je pense. Comme je suis nostalgique, j'ai decide de relire pour voir si c'etait vraiment aussi bien que dans mes souvenirs. 
 Alors bon, je trouve le style d'ecriture un peu simple, c'est cliche a souhait (le personnage de Camille bat des records), et y'a des choses completement invraisemblables MAIS j'aime enormement le monde, les pouvoirs, les guildes etc, il est plutot original. 
 Ma conclusion c'est que ca passe bien quand on est jeune mais les lacunes deviennent un peu trop visibles en grandissant. Je vais quand meme finir la trilogie qui se lit super vite. J'ai en fait surtout tres hate de m'attaquer a celle d'Elana que j'avais adore encore plus (et je crois que je n'ai jamais lu le dernier tome).

I came to this book after reading Frances Hardinge's brilliant, if terrifying, Cuckoo Song, and I was cautious that this one might be equally chilling. When I first read the cover blurb I had no idea what th expect... 
 In the underground city of Caverna, the world's most skilled craftsmen create delicacies beyond compare: cheeses that can show you the future adn perfumes that convice you to trust the wearer, even as they slit your throat. 
 ...I simply had no idea what to expect but it sounded intriguing. What I got was pageturning joy of a read involving wise men who were fools, friends who are enemies, madmen, and thieves who are friends. It's hard to talk about this book without giving away spoilers. 
 This is a fantasy adventure, clearly, with the population of people who live underground, but it needn't be a fantasy. Yes there are cheeses that can show you the future, perfumes that deceive you, and wines that give and take memories from you, and of course faces that you can learn for every occasion, but you can read this as a story set in the real world. The scary idea of Facesmiths (remember those scary doll-eating dolls in Cuckoo Song) just makes you really think about the very human condition of people who are two-faced or like our heroine Neverfell, a face can betray nothing but the truth. 
 This is a book that will keep you guessing to the very last page, and it all makes absolute, perfect sense. For a first book to read in 2015, all that follow have got some topping.",0

 What I thought: Frances Hardinge does it again. Or rather did because this came out before Cuckoo Song. But whatever. Although I would've preferred if there was a bit more character development and a bit less showing, this was a frankly glorious mix of bizarre yet awesome ideas, rather rounded characters with understandable motivations and outlooks, all delivered with an utterly rollicking pace mixed in with some incredible plot twists and metaphors that ultimately gives off the effect of a slowly building and gathering gigantic boulder that you still don't know is going to be big and well-made enough to do whatever it is you want to do with it, until it does it.

Kevin Bloom discusses the shifting sands of politics and the escalation of crime fueled by the growing hatred of South Africans of the makwerekwere, immigrant Africans. The image of the rainbow nation has been shattered. And with the clear conclusion that South Africa cannot be policed (see Jonny Steinberg's excellent ""Thin Blue: The Unwritten Rules of Policing South Africa"") the question is whether the country can survive as distrust continues to blow communities apart. This is a country that behaves as if it were at war. 
 Bloom describes the failure of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Truth is good -- those that actually stepped up and told the truth -- but justice is essential. Without it we have to question what is the future of South Africa. 
 Bloom's reason for his return to South Africa is emotional -- but his analysis of the country's crises is clear-eyed and courageous. 
 I will most definitely be looking for other books by Bloom.",0

To be honest, I really didn't remember much about Goliad from Texas history--it's been almost four decades since I had to study Texas history. 
 At first I was dissatisfied by the long character development and exposition. Then I got into Mulie (sp?) and Hickory. I found myself worrying about the characters. I worried aobut them. And I enjoyed the book.

I am so blessed with so much in life, thank you!!! I recommend this book to everyone!",0
13237327,"The Magic by Rhonda Byrne 
 I stumbled across this book in the library and funnily enough, I had been thinking a week ago that needed something that was up lifting and inspiring and may read my Creative visualisation book again. I wasn't aware of Rhonda's work at the time and even though I wasn't practically looking for this sort of book it just stood out on the shelf and I am glad that I was curious and picked it up. 
 The book teaches you about the art of gratitude and how to be grateful for all the good things in your life including the past, present and also for the things that will come to you in the future. 
 The book has 28 days for you to practise gratitude to allow it to sink in and I really enjoyed the little tasks every day. 
 Every day I wrote out 10 blessings and also had a magic rock that I held at night and thanked it for the best thing that happened that day. Then each day you have a different task, for example as you walk around the house or down the street, say thank you with each step, or say thank you for the magnificent outcome of i.e. a telephone call or think of 3 friends and write 5 things you are grateful for each and turn past mistakes into blessings. 
 I found that the tasks helped deal with disgruntled feelings that I didn't realise I had been feeling, and a complete sense of gratitude for the things I have and had and will have. 
 I used a journal that I had brought at Christmas and hadn't used yet, to write down my blessings and any of the challenges and I have just brought another one as I would like to keep going. 
 The book was written is such a lovely way, which was easy to understand and relate too. And since starting the book 28 days ago, I feel complete health, wealth and happiness; I received two unexpected cheques, a gift voucher and coupons, I have resolved relationship problems, heard from a long lost friend, I feel healthy and I have a sense of direction in life and happiness, because when things seem to not go your way, I think of the gratitude for that circumstance and it seems to sort things out and make you happy and if it makes you happy, then that is worth everything. And the Universe is the main factor of our lives as it giving you what you want and need, because its universal law that governs your whole life and ""like attracts like"" and I give thanks to the Universe every day for all the wonderful things. 
 As I mentioned before I have a creative visualisation book and cosmic ordering book and even though that mention about being grateful, it's not emphasized enough to appreciate the actual act of being grateful. 
 Thank you Rhonda for writing this beautiful book and brining happiness back in my life.

29501402,"When i start reading The Road Kill i felt that i don't understand too much. There were so many names in so few pages that i had to concentrate very hard to memorize each of them and who they are. Now i understand why obviously. It's only because there are two previous book which, unfortunately, i didn't read. 
 Leaving this apart, this book is something new for me. I've never read a book about gangsters, drugs, and about their life. This book has everything. From drug dealers and gangsters, to religion, Satan and Bible. I'm sure you all heard a few years ago about a girl who've been murdered and her body body was found after two weeks in a water tank in an hotel. Well Hanna Jameson talks about it too. 
 The book starts with Ronnie being back in USA for his brother 's release from prison. He kills his brother's lawyer, and then her starts this road trip with his friend, Eli, with the mission of finding Trent, a guy who must likely will be killed by them.

 To be honest i would have preferred to have a more palpitant trip as i found this quite unpredictable and boring from time to time. It attract my attention only at the end on The Staten Island. 
 Back in London, Daisy feels that she can't cope anymore with taking care of everything, including the Underground club, as Noel is having a bad time and is drunk every time. Nick, her boyfriend, broke up of her and asked her to move out, and Edie, her boss, intends to sell the club. 
 To end this, i would recommend it to everyone who wants to spend some quality time reading about gangsters and drug dealers and killings.

I read a lot of this book out loud to my husband, we laughed so hard about some of the scenes, and I cried too. Even though we don't eat oysters, shrimp or crab I brought my kids to the seafood counter for a little education on these creatures and where they come from. Then I bought a CD of songs from the New Orleans area to benefit the people who suffered in the hurricane. No one in the family is surprised anymore when I start talking or singing about the bayou. This author is capable of teaching very complex ecological information in a fairly simple and highly entertaining way, and you feel it in your heart. Too bad no one seems to be listening.",0
147124,"This book was special for me. It spoke of a place, of customs, and people I'd nearly forgotten because of distance and time put between us. Through weekly talks with my parents, emails of news articles, and reading of online bayou papers I've been kept informed of the disappearing Louisiana coast. My annual trips to the bayou also remind me how fast the land is sinking. I see the differences each year and they're not subtle differences. Places I used to walk, build 'camps', sit under trees and fish are now just water. Prairies of marsh grass around Leeville with little trinasse's [water channels:] meandering through the fields of green are now just open water. The community is drowning. 
 Mike Tidwell's book is non-fiction, but it reads like fiction, even like science fiction at times. His message about the disappearing coast is clear. But this is not simply a study of coastal erosion. He travels and lives with the people who call the bayou home, refugees of past wars, people pushed to the southern extremes to eke out a living; the Cajuns, the Indians, and the Vietnamese (before the giant hurricane of 1893 there was even a Chinese community living on the bayou). 
 I learned just recently that FEMA does not recognize the levee system protecting the lower Lafourche Parish. As a result of this, flood insurance is expected to triple. People are now paying nearly 3 times the amount of their mortgages on insurance. Many are forced to leave. Many don't have insurance. 
 Simply put, the taming of the Mississippi River and the oil rush of the 20th century created the problem we see today. Plans have been developed to right this wrong. But it appears that once again the Cajuns, the Indians, and the Vietnamese will have to move on and look for other lands, exiled again. 
 * ""Diz life down here,"" he says, ""it's in [the:] blood. He just don't realize it yet. He don't realize he can go wherever he wants but he'll never be happy unless he lives down de baya. What good's a job payin' a million dollars if you ain't happy?"" 
 * Before we drift off, Phan lights a final Marlboro in the dark. His Asian face glows with a faint orange hue as he says, ""I think, you know, I'm like special eel in Thailand or salmon in Alaska. Many years go by and I travel far from home and I grow up and now, much time later, I make long trip back, thousands of miles back, to place where my life began, to place where I was born."" 
 * My travels along the coast are almost over, and the sadness that comes at the end of any meaningful journey is now compounded by the very real possibility that I will never pass this way again. Not because I don't want to, but because the place won't exist. It might be gone. In all my travels around the world I've never had to say goodbye to a place in quite this manner. I've never even imagined such a place could exist. The traveler is supposed to go away, not the destination. 
 * ... land is still disappearing at the astonishing rate of 25 to 35 square miles per year.

147124,"I'm not going to lie; this book was a hard read. Not because it was difficult, or the vocabulary was outside my abilities, but because it talked so plainly about the loss of coastal wetlands in south Louisiana. 
 Journalist Mike Tidwell hitched rides of shrimp boats, crab boats, oil rig tenders and more to write what he thought would be an interesting travel story. Instead, what he got was a story that caused him to quit his job and become an environmental activist (I am not kidding). He spent time with Cajun and Vietnamese people living deep in the bayous, who were literally watching their land disappear under water (Louisiana loses the equivalent of a football feed every 5 minutes now because levees that protect the towns also stop the sedimentation that creates new wetland and barrier islands). 
 Tidwell shows us the faces behind the tragedies, interesting characters ranging from a local healer to a Vietnamese man whose family came to Louisiana after the fall of Saigon and who wants nothing more than to go home. 
 The personal stories bring the land loss home in a way that mere statistics cannot. Highly recommended.",0

13409819,"Where do I being with this book? First let me mention the cover. I absolutely love M.R. Merrick's covers. And this one is no different! The lone doorway with earth's forest on one side, (with a panther amongst the trees) and a watery forest on the other, beckons you through fire to the desolate land with dark skies and funnels of air barring down. The cover teases you with the story that rages inside! 
 Now to say that this story was a whirlwind adventure would be the understatement of the year! Once this story has you in its clutches it never lets you go. 
 Everything has changed for Chase since his 15th birthday when he was denied the power he thought he would have and exiled from the world he had always known. Hunted for years as a trophy for the underworld, Chase found friends in unlikely places and he swore to protect the innocent. Now he has power that even he doesn't know he has and struggles to control the elements raging inside him. While fighting with the loss of the only family member he had left. Blaming himself and others (won't say who, you will have to read to find out), his emotions grow out of control along with his elements. You can't help but feel for him as trials are thrown at him faster than he can blink and you wonder how is he still standing? 
 But he isn't the only thing that is out of control. Rayna the hunter/witch/ ? has to deal with the part of her that she would rather just bury. Willy too goes through a tremendous amount of growth quickly becoming one of my favorite characters. 
 From the character development, the action, and the new characters this world that M.R. Merrick has created has quickly won my heart and imagination!",0
13409819,"Actually a 4.5 star rating. Read my reviews here and on the Akamai Reader! 
 I thought this book got rolling right away. It begins with a meeting with the Circle and the action got going right away. The thrills just continue on from there, but it wasn't without rhyme or reason. The plot was well developed and well thought out. 
 I loved the way the characters continued to evolve. Chase continued to mature as a person and as a leader. Rayna continued to grow as well as Willy. Whereas Marcus peeled back his layers like an onion. While Tiki showed off his many and varied facets. 
 The addition of the pack of werecats was something I adored as they're my favorite paranormal creature. Between the werecat pride and the werewolf pack, the new characters continued to pour in and add even more sparkle to the book. 
 Chase and Rayna's relationship revved up in this book. It wasn't hot and steamy but there was definitely some chemistry. It was just the right amount of romance to the mix. It wasn't over-powering. There was enough to know that it existed and to keep it interesting. 
 The relationship between Marcus and Chase changed too. I can't give too much away, but it was enough to tug at my heartstrings. With Chase being left alone in the world with no one to care about him, it's heat-warming to know that there's an adult there that does look out for him and have his best interests at heart. 
 I love how Willy evolved in this book. I've always had a soft spot for him. I've always rooted for him and it's good to know that he gave me something to root for. His growth in this book was particularly significant to me, because it was the most radical. 
 Although the end was somewhat predictable, it didn't take away from the enjoyment of it. Needless to say, I cannot wait for the third book of this series!",0
13409819,"The Lord of the Ring(s)! Only with demon hunters instead of hobbits. And there's only 8 companions instead of 9. I loved it. It's got the same intense feel to it, with light-hearted, comical moments too. The battles, tests and travels are well-done and also reminiscent of TLOTR. I love how the heroes have setbacks instead of everything always going their way. 
 It starts with Rayna fighting her shifter 'monster' who wants to come out. Of course by the end it she does but the events leading up to it are intriguing. She is such a loyal friend. 
 Chase has horrible nightmares all through the book. I loved watching him mature into a real leader from the child he was previously. And his battles with the demons were very intense. 
 The Circle is such a group of stuffy loses that if it wasn't for the fact that some of the members are probably just brainwashed I'd say forget them all. 
 The poor condo though. I'm surprised there wasn't more question from the neighbors and authorities. And I don't like Karissa, she's going to up to something. 
 Quick Thoughts: 1)Interesting how in some books shifting is almost instantaneous and fluid while in others it's terribly painful. I'd like the painless one, please. 
 2)I want a pet like Rai!

 By Kathryn Berla 
 5 Star Review 
 12 Hours in Paradise by Kathryn Berla is your next 5 star read. Can you fall in love in 12 hours? That is the question you will be asking yourself while reading this story. Dorothy and Arash will also figure it out also. 
 Dorothy is in Hawaii vacationing with her family. Families are wonderful especially little brother, they are great, Dorthoy's little brother has a way of always embarrassing the crap out of her. 
 Arash is in Hawaii for a high school band competition. He is Persian, speaks multiple languages, is intelligent, sweet and just someone you want to be friends with. 
 This is a romantic adventure and I would love to have had this type of opportunity at a young kid. Dorothy and Arash realizing they have only 12 hours together, discovering a questionnaire claiming to make people fall in love. There are 36 questions after answering each question it leads Dorothy and Arash to opening up to each other. As answers are revealed their feelings begin to grow. Will they continue this adventure or run out of time? Do all the questions get answered and if so, where does that leave them? 
 If you were this age would you have the courage to go on this adventure? Discovering who you are and having an intense connection to someone. Could you meet it head on or would you run? I asked all these questions as I read this story. Thinking about love, remembering those feeling when just starting falling for someone, I thoroughly enjoyed this adventure into love. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to be reminded how it feels that first time, that first love.",0
29902036,"I liked it but I' needed more. The characters are good but I needed more action in the history. This book is about know another person and fall in love with him but It was a little bored. Whatever, if you like this type of book you are going to enjoy it.",0
29902036,"12 Hours in Paradise is a novel by Kathryn Berla. 
 Dorothy Patmont was coming to the end of her family holiday in Hawaii, when an encounter brought her face to face with a boy who wanted to spend time with her. Feeling reckless when the boy texts her later she sneaks out of her room and meets with this boy. They have twelve hours let together, they decided to answer thirty-six questions about themselves, to with the chance to fall in love at the end. 
 Arash Atkinson was on a school trip in Hawaii, when entering a cookie store sees a beautiful girl, it just so happens he has a chance to talk to her where they swap numbers, later that night he asks her to come out and play. 
 They both decide that the twelve hours will be an adventure, but with every hour that goes past the more dangerous it gets that Dorothy will get found out by her parents and Arash will get caught by his chaperone. As the night draws to the end, the worst happens, Arash gets a phone call to ask where is he. Will they finish the questions? Will they fall in love? Will these twelve hours be a waste? What will happen to Arash? Will Dorothy get caught by her parents? 
 Kathryn Berla has written a clever book full of adventure, fun, and the chance to fall in love. I love how as the characters answer the questions to get to know one another, so do we as the reader, you feel the emotions that they feel, you laugh and you cry with them, and eventually fall in love with them both. The book flowed, but there were no chapters so you had to wait for a natural break in the book if you wanted to put it down and pick up for it to make sense. I liked her writing style, and I found the book a good read. I rate this book four stars.",0
29902036,"3.5 Stars 
 This is the cute story of Dorothy and Arash who meet while she is on vacation with her family in Hawaii and he is there with his school on a trip. They meet when her brother drops something and Arash returns it. They exchange numbers and that night he texts her to meet him. Her family is asleep so she decides to sneak out. 
 Together, they spend twelve hours walking through Waikiki. They each answer questions that are said to make you fall in love with each other by the end. After discovering a lot about one another, the night must come to an end. Will they fall in love once all of the questions are answered? 
 This was a very quick read that entirely revolves around the two main characters answering the questions. I liked the idea, but felt like it needed more. The majority of the book was dialogue which is understandable given the context, however, I would have liked more description, more of a build-up, more in the epilogue about their lives after. I also wanted to know more how they got from point a to point b in the end of the book. There was so much potential.

 The Review 
 This book is so amazing!!!!! I normally am not for YA romances but gosh, this is brilliant. I loved the diverse characters she uses. This is the first book like this I've read where the lead guy is Persian. And can I just say YYUMMMMMM?!?!?! I felt like both characters had great development and were well written. Normally I'm wary of insta love in YA books but Kathryn made it work in a beautiful and actual believable way. This book was super adorable as it was heart warming. I was glued to every page falling in love with our main characters as their relationship developed. Thank you Kathryn for giving me this book in exchange for my honest review! 5 stars from me!

Gabriel comes across her and finds it difficult to face her as a human with no knowledge of herself as a Deity. Then you have Deidre's confusion at finding out about immortals, demons and deitys.

 I loved how Elena was with Judge Kingsley. He has a reputation around town because he has closed himself off to everyone, but Elena pushes right past all that and kind of takes over his home.

James loves the stability of statics, facts, and numbers because they are really wrong and normally won't let you down like people tend to do. Get this book now!",0
34382839,"Shae McCullough, the lone female Station Seventeen female firefighter, refuses to have a relationship with one of her firefighter teammates; Shae thrives on the adrenaline rush of her chosen profession, but doesn't need the complications that it could cause. On a call to a fire scene in a meth lab, Shae finds two dead men: one apparently died of smoke inhalation, however the other one was clearly murdered: his throat was slit. Upon looking more closely, Shae is convinced that the fire was arson, and true to her rebellious nature, she gets herself suspended from active duty because of her big mouth. Again. 
 James Capelli, an intelligence officer for the Remington Police Department but not a cop. He is bored, he has nothing to do, until the he is asked to investigate the met lab fire. Capelli doesn't like crime scenes, and he doesn't know how he will ever manage when he meets Shae, who has been relocated for two weeks in his unit. She is impulsive, seems to act before she thinks, she operates on emotion; she is everything Capelli is not. And he doesn't understand why he could ever be attracted to this woman who threatens his well-ordered world. 
 And did Kimberly Kincaid ever do her research! I felt I was watching an action movie rather than reading! Shae and Capelli are the ultimate polar opposites, and I loved Shae even though she is reckless, and bends the rules a tad too much, she is dynamic, passionate and thorough in her own way. She did make me a bit dizzy at the beginning with her abundance of energy; I could almost hear her talking at lightning speed. On the other hand, Capelli did not appeal to me in the least. Maybe it's because I have encountered men just like him, and it colours my perception, but still I felt he came across like a Vulcan but without Mr. Spock's particular charm. I think it might have to do with the author's persistent reminders on his being logical, methodical, weighing the odds, calculating probabilities. Capelli, to me, was a robot, and I couldn't fathom why Shae was attracted to him, at least initially, even though he is supposed to be ever so handsome. I understood she liked to tease him, but still, it's a far cry from becoming infatuated with - let's be honest - an emotionless, dull, boring, however an enticing male specimen he might be. Or maybe it's just me, but I couldn't understand Shae's attraction, although I understood Capelli's. I felt he came alive only during the amazingly hot sex scenes. Both Shae and Capelli showed growth, and I felt it was more convincing in Shae's case. However, I thought they made a fabulous investigating team because their thought processes were so different, and I would have liked if they had been part of a spin-off series, although not as lovers. 
 DEEP BURN is a fabulously crafted suspense story, the writing is flawless, it's extremely fast-paced, thoroughly entertaining, and Ms. Kincaid gives us enough details to keep us enthralled without weighing down the narrative. Although the romance didn't work for me, I would definitely recommend DEEP BURN because it's one of this year's best suspense stories!

 Our main characters are firefighter Shae McCullough and Remington's Intelligence Unit surveillance expert, James Capelli. 
 Both characters are strong, though it took me a while to like Shae. She is impulsive and when put on desk work, she hones in on her instincts, much to the dismay of James Capelli. But once they start working together to solve an arson case, the attraction becomes apparent. 
 The story is filled with suspense, dangerous fires, dead bodies, James's past coming back to haunt him, too many coincidences, and of course romance. 
 Let's not forget a good cast of secondary characters. 
 In addition to all this, it's also a story about how our past, whether as a child or later in life, affects us to be who we are today.

 World War II alternate histories tend to follow the same formula. Usually they are set in a world where the Axis are victorious and may or may not have occupied Britain and/or the United States. Occasionally you will see something different, usually along the lines of the war itself being fought differently instead of focusing on the nightmare outcome I previously mentioned. A good example of this is Acts of War by James Young. 
 Now Acts of War is actually the second book of James' The Usurper's War series, however, since the events of Acts of War take place before the events of book one, ""Pandora's Memories"" (which is actually a short story), this is one of the few instances where you don't need to start with the first story in the series. That is good for me because I haven't read ""Pandora's Memories"" yet, but I may do so now that I've read Acts of War. 
 This novel is set in a world where Hitler is killed by a (un)lucky strike by a Royal Air Force bomber in 1940. Two years later, Germany has not invaded the Soviet Union and has instead focused on knocking Britain out of the war, which it finally succeeds in doing after a massive firebombing of London, complete with poison gas. A new British government sues for peace, but the Royal Family and many elements of military rebel after the new peace treaty stipulates that British must hand over all foreign fighters to the Germans on British soil. With a ""Usurper"" now on the throne, the rebel British try to rally the Commonwealth to keep the war going. 
 Meanwhile, Japan has had some pretty bad luck after their attack on the Soviets got them kicked off the continent. This disaster has taught them their lesson and with new technology from the Germans and bases ceded to them by the defeated British, the Japanese have decided now is their chance to finally strike at the Americans, but without the element of surprise they had in our timeline. 
 All of this is told from the point of view of mostly American soldiers (with a couple American civilians and Japanese officers thrown in) preparing to enter a war that most people know is coming, but really hope they can avoid, especially now that the British have been knocked out of the fight. Generally I enjoyed the story, finding it a nice change of pace from the usual grimdark Nazi-wanks that dominate alternate history. James' strength as a writer was most apparent during the naval and aerial battle scenes. You can really see the research he put into these scenes. 
 Admittedly I found that some of the character development scenes were a touch too long. This isn't bad, per se, because having complex characters is important and we don't want to fall into the trap of what Karen Hellekson calls ""battlefield fetishism"". That being said, sometimes I like detailed and exciting action scenes and that is what I was in the mood for when I sat down to read Acts of War. Again the scenes weren't bad, but five or ten percent of their text could have been cut and I would have been happier. 
 Despite all that and a few typos, I still found James' Acts of War to be enjoyable read that I can recommend to anyone looking for a good war alternate history. If you are interested in more of James' work, check out his article, ""Nagumo's Missing Turkey: The Kido Butai's 'Third Strike' at Pearl Harbor"", on Alternate History Weekly Update.",0
1126999,A wish something as interesting as this happens to me when I sit at a cafe... :D Very addictive indeed. A very plausible story and a typical Reacher style solution to the dilemma. This time the action even spread outside America - yeii :),0
1126999,This rather uneven entry to the Reacher canon is largely filled with a seemingly interminable sleuthing exercise rife with ham-fisted red herrings. Jack Reacher diehards willing to schlog through this monotonous trudge will be rewarded with a remarkably funny interlude in which Reacher haggles over pennies with a Chinatown merchant and a pleasantly brisk conclusion in London and rural England.,1

25700137,"To Thee Is This World Given is a rather interesting story set in the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse. The entire novella takes place over the course of one night about a chance encounter with two survivors. A rather philosophical conversation takes place on the ways to survive and what it means to survive. 
 A thought provoking story as one of the survivor's has the stereotypical ""me"" behavior of doing whatever it takes to stay alive and the other questions that way of living. The book really could've been set in any disaster situation as it's more focused on survival and living in the aftermath. 
 A well written short read that is worth checking out.

20986695,"This magnificent masterpiece has left me yet again, entranced in the world of Jacob Rune and his amazing adventures. The characters in this story are virtually amazing and a lot of fun to read about. I love the action, suspense, and humor that is brought forth in this phenomenal story. When this author puts pen to paper and begins to write, he brings a magic all of his own and lures us in and keeps us on the edge of our seats throughout the whole story. We are always left in shock and awe by each story this author releases for us to read and this one is no different. If you are like me, you will been craving more once you read this memorable story. It's a great read for teens and teens at heart to read and enjoy and I highly recommend this to all. I am really excited to read about the next adventure that Jacob and friends go on next. 
 As I sit and type my review, if in the end, will good, yet again, triumph over evil or will evil win?",0
20986695,"Dang the explosive ride began right from the get go, and you were flying right along with Jake, Pete and the rest of the gang!!!! 
 Author JH Glaze to this day has never let me down as I immerse myself into each story that he has written, and this case the RUNE series... the wait was so well worth it as I once again found myself hanging onto each word and page as I flew like crazy through this episode or installment in the series. 
 Man oh man has Jake and the gang have a unrelenting task unraveling right before their eyes as the BOOK relieves to them the next locations of the scrolls that he HAS to recover in order to complete his missions. His destiny must be completed at all costs, and the costs are getting higher and higher with each mission he sets out on. 
 The forces are growing stronger and unrelenting in their efforts to stop Jake from being successful!!! Then again so are Jake's powers growing with each task he sets out on. But, so far Jake is managing to stay just ahead of the evil forces that are chasing him. Will Jake continue to be able to retrieve the scrolls necessary to complete his destiny? 
 You're going to grab this series to dive into the masterful non-stop action packed suspense YA thriller to find the answers that may be swirling around in your mind. I highly recommend that you do!!! 
 Now I must impatiently wait for the next episode to explode on my kindle!!! Ughhhh please hurry Mr. Glaze as this person here in already tapping her foot, shaking her finger at you for leaving me with yet another major cliffhanger... 
 Recommend: YA and up

20986695,"As per usual this series brings action, tension and a high octane breathless chase to save humanity. This particular installment kicks off with a bang and never releases the tension! 
 For the age group intended, it is perfect, for us older folk this is a brilliant release from our everyday lives! 
 I am addicted to this series. 
 So why not give it a try yourself and see if it is a fit for you?

328,"Full disclosure: I'm quite a weak player at the time of reading this. I don't expect reading this book will make much difference to my strength either. Rowson mentions in an endnote that he basically agrees with the dictum that at my level studying tactics is about all that matters for improvement. Like another reviewer much of the annotations for the games was over my head. 
 On the other hand it was an entertaining read. It's not meant to be any kind of doctrine. The style was engaging. It really feels like hanging out with an interesting, educated, thoughtful grandmaster and just listening to him talk about how he thinks about the game. He comes across as enthusiastic and modest in pleasant way. 
 I can see though that it might take a certain kind of person to enjoy this book. I think you have to be able to enjoy some spitballing that doesn't really translate to direct variations or concrete how to's. I think that's why as a weak player it might be easy for me to enjoy it because I don't have deeply held mental attitudes about chess, so it's fun for me to just kind of listening to him rap about stuff. I certainly don't think though that he's expecting anyone to read this and come away going ""Yes, Rowson has it all figured out."". It's just not that kind of book. I think rather they are interesting ideas that hopefully can enrich how I think about the game as I (hopefully) grow and get stronger.",0
328,A very intersting book on chess for advanced players giving an original perpective of the game. Encourages you to think with your head and not to learn uncritically.Recommended.,0

328,Excellent! It helps to think differently!,2
10740411,"This book is a perfect example of why I shouldn't judge a book by its cover! After seeing the cover and reading the synopsis, I decided that I'd skip reading this one despite it being the monthly pick for my bookclub. Because after all, I don't normally read non-fiction or religious books (jeez, I sound so pretentious and snooty!). Then I felt guilty. So I climbed down off my high horse, downloaded a sample on my nook and, by the end of the sample, I was hooked and immediately downloaded the rest! Lesson learned! 
 Some of the members of my bookclub didn't finish this one as they got bored and didn't care for Denver, but I found myself sucked in by the excellent writing and actually enjoyed Denver's ""unique"" voice. 
 Denver and Ron take turns narrating their story, and it's easy to tell who is speaking because Denver has a strong accent and uses slang quite a bit. Their stories were more interesting than I expected, and I really grew to care about them. Actually got tears in my eyes during Deborah's battle with cancer! 
 Faith is a strong component in their lives, but I appreciated that there was no preaching involved and that it was just presented as a matter-of-fact part of their lives. I think part of the reason I don't enjoy books with a religious bent is because I don't enjoy being preached to, so I think that the religious aspects of this story were well handled. 
 Sincerely hope that I remember to never judge a book by its cover/synopsis again and to at least read a few paragraphs first, as I wound up really liking this story! I found Denver the more interesting man, as his life has been totally different than mine. Ron was a little irritating at times, but he grew on me as well. Well worth the read if you enjoy non-fiction. Or even if you don't and just want an interesting, well-written story!",0
10740411,"Absolutely loved this book! The writing is phenomenal. And I love a true story written from two points of view. 
 This tale about a black man who grew up as a share cropper and ended up homeless on the city streets and an art dealer and his wife who step into his world is utterly compelling. How these two men become acquainted is poignant and funny. 
 I love the way God's will is portrayed. It's a beautiful picture of real life (which this is of course), no sugar coating on this story. 
 Something I loved -- not knowing what was to come. This is not a formula story, but it is brutal and beautiful.

 Die gruselige und spannende Geschichte eines neugierigen Madchens, welches eine Tur in eine andere Welt findet und Gefahr lauft, sich in ihr zu verlieren. 
 Neil Gaiman hat einen sehr unterhaltsamen Schreibstil und mischt hier und da etwas Grusel und Furcht hinzu. Durchweg herrscht eine sehr dichte Atmosphare und man kann das Buch gar nicht mehr aus den Handen legen.

 Ihre Eltern haben wenig Zeit, sodass sich Coraline die meiste Zeit mit sich selbst beschaftigen muss, z.B. in Form von Entdeckungsreisen, die sie fur ihr Leben gern macht. 
 Auf einer ihrer Entdeckungsreisen entdeckt sie in der Wohnung eine Tur, die jedoch ins Nirgendwo fuhrt, denn sie ist zugemauert. Zusammen mit ihrer Mutter glaubt sie, dass die Tur in die alte, leere Wohnung von nebenan fuhrt. 
 Doch Coraline kann die Tur nicht vergessen. 
 Ein paar Tage spater erfahrt Coraline von ihrer Nachbarn, dass sie in Gefahr schweben wurde - das sagen zumindest die Teeblatter. Doch in welcher Gefahr Coraline dabei wirklich steckt, bemerkt sie erst viel zu spat.. 
 Nail Geilman hat mit ""Coraline"" ein gruseliges Marchen a la ""Alice im Wunderland"" geschaffen, dass vor allem jungere Leser und Horer begeistert. 
 Die Sprache ist ein wenig gewohnungsbedurftig, jedoch gewohnt man sich auch schnell an diesen. 
 Die Charaktere sind wunderbar beschrieben. Vor allem Coraline schliesst man schnell in sein Herz. 
 Man merkt recht schnell, dass Coraline anders ist, als andere Kinder. Wahrend die meisten Kinder bei Langeweile schnell an den PC gehen oder Unsinn treiben, geht Coraline lieber auf Entdeckungstour. Das konnen Orte, aber auch Tiere sein. 
 Das Cover ist wunderschon und uberzeugt mit seinen tollen Farben. Auch die Kurzbeschreibung enthalt das Wichtigste und halt, was es verspricht. 
 Anna Thalbach ist als Sprecherin ein Highlight. Es ist immer wieder faszinierend, wie sie es schafft, jedem noch so kleinen Charakter seine ganz eigene Stimme zu verleihen. 
 Dieses Horbuch ist vor allem fur jungere Horer geeignet, die Spass am Gruseln haben. Empfehlenswert!",0

364955,"Luffy engages in a really hard battle with Don Krieg, who uses many nasty tricks to win the battle. And yet, Luffy is able to defeat him at last, and that saves the floating restaurant Baratie. 
 Sanji reveales his dream to find All Blue, and overhearing it, Zeff asks Luffy to take Sanji with him. It's a sad parting between Sanji and the others from Baratie, yet Luffy finally get his fourth crew and a cook! They go after Zoro and Usopp in a small boat, and for the very first time they have been introduced to the term Shichibukai, or the Seven Warlords, pirates so great they are approved by the government. The world of pirate's getting more interesting and deeper here, no? 
 Meanwhile, Zoro and Usopp pursuing Nami long before Luffy finishes his battle with Don Krieg has arrived in Arlong Park. It turns out that Nami has been there as well. Unexpectedly, Usopp meets Nojiko, who reveals the dark truth of the area and admits that she is Nami's sister. Meanwhile, the mermen have caught Zoro and bring him to Arlong, and Zoro finds Nami there as well. Is that really true that Nami is actually a part of the crew of Arlong the Merman? 
 Well, after Eiichiro Oda reveals the past of Luffy, Zoro, Usopp & Sanji, I am looking forward to know Nami's past as well.",0

 After Luffy and the gang meets the cook Sanji, the restaurant ship is attacked by the fearsome Captain Don ""Diamond Armor"" Kreig. It is Sanji's goal in life is to never let a man starve in front of him. So he feeds Don Kreig only to be spit in the face for payment. I can't tell you how much these chapters really pissed me off. I was outraged, I threw things, and I cried for the cruelty of it all. Don't miss this story of how Sanji joins Luffy's crew! 
 Cheers and Happy Reading!",0
364955,"Luffy, Sanji, and Gin survive Don Krieg's poisonous gas attack. Luffy stands up to the pirate, proclaiming, ""I won't die."" And he means it! He attacks, and actually succeeds in bringing Krieg down on one knee, a feat never before accomplished! But can he handle Krieg's Mighty Battle Spear? 
 As Chef and Sanji watch the battle between Luffy and Krieg, Chef comments on Luffy's toughness. ""In the end, it's not about weapons,"" he says, ""grit counts more than steel."" The fight continues. Whatever Krieg throws at him, Luffy comes back with his usual tenacity, and using the weapons in his own gum gum arsenal. 
 After Krieg is defeated, Gin takes his leave, deciding to stay with Krieg, but his parting words for the unconscious Luffy state that he expects their paths to cross again on the Grand Line. 
 Sanji tells Luffy he can't join his crew, but Luffy doesn't believe him. Sanji asks him if he's ever heard of the All Blue? The cooks on the Baratie start behaving strangely (even for them), claiming that Sanji's cooking is horrible. It's obvious they have ulterior motives, especially when the Crap Geezer asks Luffy to take Sanji with him. 
 Luffy and Sanji leave the Baratie and sail on in order to catch up with Nami. Along the way, Luffy learns about the Seven Warlords of the Sea, and how dangerous they are. Hawkeye Mihawk, who defeated Zolo, is one of them, and the other six are even worse. They head toward Arlong Park, home of the fish men, led by ""Saw Tooth"" Arlong. Yosaku thinks that is where Nami is headed, judging by her interest in a wanted poster containing information on pirates and bounties. Sanji, being obsessed with Nami, is all for following her. 
 Meanwhile, Zolo and Usopp are also hot on Nami's trail, and make a couple of new friends. 
 Most of this volume is taken by the battle between Luffy and Krieg, which is pretty good, unless you don't like battles, of course. We see some interesting moves on both sides. Naturally, Luffy prevails. He's the hero. Then it's time to move on. 
 The floating restaurant was a cool idea, but it's time for the action to resume in other directions, and to catch up with Nami, Zolo, and Usopp. 
 As the series progresses, we see more and more of Luffy's qualities, especially his loyalty to his friends, and his never give up attitude. He's a good role model for people of all ages. I like the depth the author gives his characters, as well as the humor, and the action. 
 By the time the series is done, I know I won't remember all of these characters, there are so many of them, but a few will stick with me for a long time to come: Luffy, Zolo, Shanks and Usopp among them. 
 Luffy's indefatigable good humor and buoyant spirits, and his willingness to take risks to achieve his goals make this an enjoyable series for everyone.",0

 I really feel for Matt. He was so ready to become a father but not like he did, not without his beloved wife. Life sometimes has other plans whether we like it or not. Matt thrusts himself into trying to care for his newborn daughter while wondering all the while if he was doing what his wife, Liz, would be doing if she were there.

121127,"The best of Goodkinds books. It only goes downhill from here, might as well stop reading.",0
121127,"This book reveals Goodkind's political agenda to its greatest extent thus far. The particular targeted issues are Communism/Socialism, Labor Unions, and even welfare to a lesser extent. The Imperial Order is clearly a stand in for a Communist society and the story illustrates how problematic such a government is. 
 More potentially offensive to readers is the attack on labor unions, depicting them as inefficient and unfair. This story overtly attacks the notion of selflessness and shows its devotees to be misguided at best and delusional or corrupt at worst. Jagang, the series antagonist, can be seen as a kind of Stalin figure here. The story tries to tell people who may be sympathetic to Communism, or to a lesser degree, Socialism, that such sympathy is dangerous. Despite it's messages, it does provide an engaging and satisfying story, but magic and hard fantasy take a back seat to politics and are not seen much at all. 
 The book raises the question of whether conservative politics, or any politics for that matter, belong in epic fantasy. It also kind of seems that the vehicle of fantasy used to discuss these issues has largely been vacated for the themes at this point in the series now that many readers have been hooked. Despite that it may be hard for readers who are sympathetic to leftist causes, labor unions, or even social justice issues to stomach, the story does contribute interestingly to political discussion and does have valid points, particularly in it's indictment of Communism. Also, the book does promote secular humanism and somewhat attacks religions for being controlling of the human spirit and causing people to misguidedly do harm to others while thinking they are doing good and God's will. It champions to glory of the human spirit and of individuality, attacking any religion or governmental system that seeks to limit or control it. 
 Strangely, the book kind of reads like a Fantasy version of Horatio Alger's Ragged Dick, showing a downtrodden young man making everything and everyone go his way by taking initiative, showing ingenuity, and embracing the fundamentals of Capitalism. The book also follows Goodkind's now established formula, which is becoming cliched. Once again, the two lovers are recovering from their last ordeal and are beginning to finally really enjoy time together, when once again, great tragedy separates them against their will and their love is once more mutually unrequited. 
 This installment in the Sword of Truth also largely focuses on the villainous character of Nicci (yes, the antagonist's name is Nicci), who comes to the forefront. We learn that she was corrupted by an ultra-leftist upbringing and once again, we see Richard begin to shape and influence his opposition with his righteous Ayn Randian messages. Despite the heavyhandedness and even though the messages can be abrasive, it is nice to see Epic Fantasy engaging with pertinent themes and breaking oway from the cliches of it all being derivitave of Tolkein and Lewis with nothing new to offer.",0
121127,"It was awesome, possibly the best out of the series that I've read so far.",0
121127,"This chapter in the story of Richard and Kahlan was leaps and bounds better than Soul of the Fire. It definitely had some of the magic back that made the first two so amazing. Unfortunately, Goodkind spent most of the novel having his characters preach his philosophies to us, which became exhausting and overpowering. This book really shines when he lets his characters act on those ideals instead of just preaching about them.",0
121127,"Finally! The story starts getting better! It is about as good as Wizard's First Rule! I was interested from the very beginning all the way through to the end. It is definitely one of the better books in the series so far. 
 The beginning is a little slow, but I was still interested because Richard and Kahlan (along with Cara) finally get to be together without any distractions. Then, all of the sudden their time together was ruined! :( They are separated again throughout the majority of this novel; however, I still found it to be extremely entertaining. Kahlan is involved in many battles when she rejoins with the D'Haran army. Believe me when I say that some of these battles are very interesting. Though her story isn't as good as Richard's, I was still excited to read about the battles taking place. Richard was taken to the heart of the Imperial Order by Nicci, a Sister of the Dark. I don't want to say too much about this and give things away. However, I will say that it was fascinating to read about the Old World and why they are so hated. You get to meet people and read about how they live under the rule of the Imperial Order,and the horrible carvings they have to create. It's no wonder why Richard and Kahlan want to destroy the Imperial Order and save these people. 
 Throughout the story we get to see a different side of Richard. We always see him destroy with his Sword, but this time he is without his Sword, so we get to see him create! He is very talented with the help of his gift. There was a lot of anticipation and excitement in Richard's story to see how he was going to handle the situation he was in. With Kahlan's life on the line Richard will do anything! 
 I have to admit that I do not like Nicci! As the story went on I just couldn't believe how ignorant she was even when she gets to the Old World with Richard. Goodkind really brought out my feelings (both good and bad) towards Richard and Nicci in this novel. 
 Goodkind is a little better with his writing in this novel, though there was some repetition. His detail was amazing! I really felt like I was there with both Richard and Kahlan. You just have to get used to how Goodkind writes his novels and you will enjoy them even more. 
 Overall, this was one of the best stories so far; I give it a well deserved 5 stars! I found it to be very interesting and especially entertaining. I was engrossed in the novel all the way until the end!",0

 This starts a chain of actions that well, fill the whole book. This book is one long roller coaster ride of fast-paced plot twists.

 Spinning off from ""Chosen by the Vampire Kings"" this book starts off as a behind the scenes to Stephany's kidnapping. In the Chosen series there were traits within Brant and Zane that I wished were together in one character and here we have it, all wrapped up in the Alpha wolf Ward. Big and brawny, but loyal and honorable, protective of his domain and those in his custody. Initially I felt sorry for Lance but I can't help rooting for Ward either. Much more romantic than Chosen that's for sure. Really looking forward to how this story reveals itself.",0

I agree that children should be treated with respect and that their feelings be validated, and the book has helped me react with more kindness, but some of the advice is absurd. Don't take kids on errands with you because they'll be bored?? Errands aren't a party for me, either, but that's life. Boredom is a normal part of life, and so are responsibilities. Don't make them pick up their toys? Um, I'll help, but that's their responsibility. Children should be nurtured but not sheltered. I think this book doesn't advocate the proper balance between discipline and respect. That being said, parenting styles are personal, so it might work for you.

(For example not keeping sugar in the house at all if you don't want your child to have it). It is a very radical approach to parenting that will work for some people. I plan on drawing from much of her perspectives when I have kids.,0

22605657,"Poets in Hell (Heroes in Hell Book 17) 
 by Janet Morris 
 An astounding anthology of poetry, which will entice many readers into the breaking of fire bleeding from Satan's depths. 
 In a very clever an interesting way, this collection has been crafted as the poets antagonise and and challenge the birth of their creations in this amazing work that encounters many important figures of history. 
 Get ready to trawl these pages with Satan, the Damned, Guy Fawkes, and Hell - you are in for an awakening! 
 The work explores all facets of emotion, some disturbing and requiring punishment; best not be tormented and yearning for compassion in this gruesome adult read. 
 Genius concept 5*****",1
22605657,"Four stars only, for now, out of fairness resulting from the incomplete nature of this brief review... 
 Full disclosure: I've only been able to read Joe Bonadonna's ""We the Furious"" and Janet and Chris Morris' ""Seven Against Hell"" so far, but I was compelled to leave a comment due to the sporadic, distracted nature of my pleasure-reading these days. But I am impressed, and I didn't want to leave that initial impression unmarked. Ongoing impressions may be added later---what audacity, this guy flashes, eh?! 
 Call this...a ""serialized review,"" if you will. 
 These two tales in POETS IN HELL are very different in tone and approach, which divergence provides a pair of dynamic gateways into the wildly inventive, shared-world ""in Hell"" series (this being the 17TH BOOK inspired by the fertile Janet Morris concept---!). 
 Unique, sometimes challenging, and mind-blowingly inventive---all these perceptions apply to this entire Morris-series creation involving eternal struggles in the Underworld that transcend simplistic notions like despair and and resignation to a final fate. 
 Oh, no, says this ambitious Morris series: Think ye that Hell is the bitter END to all thy strivings? that consignment to Hell might at least impart some...""repose"" in surrender to everlasting torment? Think again, O ye who enter here---SURPRISE! There's SO much more to suffer and vie for, even in the grim Circles of the Pit. (Does the human spirit EVER quit aspiring toward ascendancy, even to relative status in misery?) 
 So many plates are kept spinning overhead (or rather, underworld) in this vast and varied tapestry of literary, historical and fictional characters interacting amidst Perdition's flames in a feverish (what other kind could there be, in Hell?) competition to curry favor, deceive, and otherwise self-aggrandize themselves (did you expect altruistic motivations, in HELL?!) in the Father of Lies' domain. 
 Every writer represented in this anthology (and the others) is forced to literally go through...well---HELL to fall within the parameters of the shared-world vision, and yet deliver something with a personal storytelling stamp (not to mention indulge themselves in some passionate manipulation of favorite characters). 
 Now that's DAMNED hard to do (sorry). And it appears that the several fantasy writers within the pages of the present volume go the extra mile, paving the road to Hell with their most earnest personal visions of eternal striving, passion and manipulation even in damnation. 
 The Morrises' ""Seven Against Hell"" is a potent dose of their usual finely wrought classicism, in tone, yielding a story of larger-than-life characters who are nonetheless very rooted in recognizable, soberingly human emotions and motivations. Bonadonna's ""We the Furious"" is a much different, wildly nostalgic and amusingly referential collision of incongruous characters (Frankenstein and his creation! Galatea and Gulliver! joining skillfully fleshed-out original characters---""Frankenstein"" constructs whose ""parts and stitching"" kept me guessing) on a joint (and sometimes cross-purposed) mission that leads to surprising corners of Hell. Not to mention unexpected resolutions. 
 There's nothing quite like this venerable, long-running, shared-world series, refreshed yet again with POETS IN HELL. I look forward to reading more.",4

 Go to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company. - Mark Twain 
 You can always count on Mark Twain. What he doesn't mention is rains of fire flakes, hell horses, demons, devils, lawyers, and billions of the Damned, many of whom weren't exactly the nicest people in life. 
 Hell is an Equal Opportunity kind of place. Mess up, and you'll end up on Slab A being worked over by the Undertaker, who isn't the most pleasant chap. Really mess up and Satan will display your still living body parts for all to see, before sending you to the Undertaker. 
 The Damned are in Hell for punishment. And punished they will be, often by other of the Damned. King or beggar, Hell will be one Hell of a trip for all of them. A short trip in many cases. Back to the Undertaker, who sometimes makes minor mistakes, like putting your arms where your legs are supposed to go. You've got to pity the poor guy though, he's just been swamped since Guy Fawkes used a nuclear weapon on the Hall of Injustice. 
 This is the seventeenth book in the series, and no, you don't need to read the earlier books first. Janet Morris has done her usual incredible job of pulling together a group of talented writers, and sending them on a mission to help with the punishment. 
 You'll meet old friends, and new friends in Hell. Just don't turn your back on them if you have the 'Get Out of Hell Free Card!' 
 And never enter Hell without your sword/spear/bow/pistol/nuclear weapon at hand and ready for use. Oh, no, you took the safety off and are bleeding to death. Let me relieve you of your money and gun, and say 'Hello to the Undertaker for me!'",6
22605657,"Where could one find Shakespeare, Marlowe, Homer, Diomedes, Frank Nitti, Victor Frankenstein, Emily Dickinson, Mary Shelley and Merlin in one place? The answer is Janet and Chris Morris's shared world of Hell. Aspiring authors, renowned poets and playwrites vie for attention, fame and recognition, with the odd exception most fail in many diabolic ways. 
 The stories range from the deeply moving, to the heroic, to the downright amusing as the denizens double and triple cross one another, form uneasy alliances, and try and outwit Satan, not to mention try to win the poetry slam.... 
 Although written by a variety of authors the stories flow well, and the characters complement each other. Dark and delicious, devious and deadly with devilry aplenty in the darkest realm - is a perfect summing up of this instalment of Heroes in Hell. Most certainly fantasy at its darkest and wittiest!",10
22605657,"It's hard to know what to expect from a book titled 'Poets in Hell', at least I hadn't a clue until I turned the first page. What I got was something quite mad, that's mad in an absolutely wild, clever, surreal and brilliant way. 
 I like fantasy, and I like it dark, this is probably what attracted me to a book set in the vast expanse of hell, what a brilliant playground for a group of writers to unleash their imaginations. Of course, the idea of a collection of stories about poets doesn't exactly conjure an image of action and adventure, but I can say, this group of wordsmiths may have lived sedate, studious lives, but death gets seriously real for them. There is such a wild, eclectic mix of characters in this collection, all bound together with a common theme, and a running consistency that speaks of very clever world building, behind the scenes. Although each author has his or her own take on hell and the, madcap adventures they put their characters through, there are also common themes and characters binding the collection together and giving the book a strong feel of oneness, giving the reader the feel of roving through the many layers of hell, like some kind of traveller roaming through space and time witnessing all of the action up close. 
 As I said there are consistent rules running through the collection. Wars are fought in hell, murders committed, anything that happened in life can happen in hell, but generally with horrible consequences. Food tastes like shit, literally, nothing is as it seems, if something appears good it's most likely just a trick of the devil's to torment the soul even further. Shakespeare, Yeats, Genghis Khan, Napoleon Bonaparte, Helen of Troy... the cast is endless and limitless. They live, love and lose all in hell. 
 A good book? Hell yeah!",10
6359544,"It is a shame that this book, unlike the whole of Dawkins' brilliant collection of evolution-themed books, came out after his current incarnation, along with Christopher Hitchens, as the world's token atheist. Certainly he has every right to believe, or rather not believe, in whatever he chooses; instead I fear that that designation will publicly override the brilliant and important message of this very necessary book. Dawkins' book concisely and articulately offers succinct, clear, and easy to follow facts illustrating the truth of natural selection. And it couldn't be timelier; Dawkins stated reason for writing this book, directed at the non-scientist, is the horrendously embarrassing poll numbers that show a deplorable 44% of Americans are young-earth creationists. I have a couple of points to make. 
 First, I would doubt any of the young-earthers - Dawkins refers to them as 'history-deniers' - match Dawkins love and devotion to the natural world. In elegant prose, and dazzlingly full color photographs, Dawkins paints a picture of nature both beautiful and graceful. The evidence he offers supporting the established truth of evolution theory are clear and easy to follow. He is at times pedantic, often hysterical, and always enthusiastic. Like Carl Sagan, Dawkins has the talent of making science exiting for all. 
 Second, in light of all that, Dawkins is not interested in casually converting the deniers. He makes no attempt to mask his contempt for those that so mindlessly dismiss reason. He is on the offense here; the 44%, likely already adverse to Dawkins due to his noted atheism, will not find an understanding teacher here. He is factual, harsh, concise. He has no intention of sympathetically converting the non-believers; he simply wants to state the evidence and illustrate why creationism fails. 
 So, then, how do I feel about this? Is Dawkins harsh, matter of fact approach reasonable, or ought he to show respect for biblical literalism and religious devotion, seeking instead a balance between religion and science? The fact of the matter is that this problem - and make no mistake the denial of evolution is a real problem - is indicative of a much larger problem in America today: scientific illiteracy. So many Americans are 'history deniers;' should, then, it come as any shock that, in this country today, a Playboy model and a goofball comedian are given the same credibility as the entire medical establishment regarding autism and vaccines, despite the fact that they push the opposite view? Should it come as any shock that the health care debate, where reasonable discussion regarding policy and governmental rolls are appropriate, can instead be hijacked by the ludicrous assumption that the President and the Congress are advocating the wholesale slaughter of the elderly? That the debate on such complex system dynamics as those that govern climate change can be reduced to a scientifically inappropriate yes or no 'belief?' That scientists and experts are dismissed as elitists; egg heads that deserve to be selectively ignored? That a 3rd rate actress from that damn Jack Ritter show can hit the talk show circuit instigating fear and distrust in established, tested, validated medicine and a convicted felon can pen a book regarding cures ""they"" - the wicked scientist - don't want you to know about, and we Americans, rather than laughing at their snake oil, send them instead to the best seller list? That all of this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the process of the scientific method and peer review? Should, then, we be shocked that American kids are failing worldwide in science and math scores? And we can ignore this disbelief in natural selection, 200 years to the year since Darwin's birth and 150 years to the year since he published his revolutionary work? I can see why Dawkins is so angry. We all should be. 
 There's my tirade. Whew. That said, unlike Dawkins, I will concede that attacking the 44% so relentlessly is not the best approach to solve this problem. Because this problem must - MUST! - be solved. Dawkins reputation and his methods will ultimately contribute to further polarization. Americans simply cannot afford the battle between science and religion to endure any longer: if you believe in a God who created us, then it goes without saying he created us to be rational and reasonable and can't, I would imagine, be too pleased with the plague of scientific illiteracy debilitating humanity. The scientific method not only must be taught, it must be understood, employed and adopted. Our future depends on it...",0
6359544,"I've been mousing around for 5 years trying to open my mind to the full glory and immensity of evolution. Several books lead me along the path, but this might be the first to fully enlighten me. I find it funny to resort to language like ""glory"" and ""enlighten"" in order to defend an evolutionist's manifesto against christian creationism. I suppose knowledge can be just as spiritual and soulful a pursuit as religion. The Greatest Show on Earth is first-rate mind blowing stuff. Dawkins technically persuasive book on evolution is scaled back just enough so I can understand the multiple sciences supporting evolution. His clear and concise science writing and his sensational subject are both deserving of the title, ""The Greatest Show on Earth."" An updated version of his book should be read every 10 years ... by everyone! Regarding the beauty and endurance of evolution, a favorite quote comes to mind, ""Ever present never twice the same, ever changing never less then whole.""",0
6359544,"Scientists have their opinions regarding the diversity of life, and Creationists have theirs. Clearly both deserve equal time for their ideas in the classroom. 
 Ah .... If only one group had performed extensive research garnering mountains of evidence from such diverse fields as biology, paleontology and genetics to develop a theory (not a hypothesis, but rather a system of ideas that have been confirmed by observation and experiment to account for known facts) which seamlessly and elegantly both explained and made testable predictions about nature. And .... if the other group had yet to publish a single peer reviewed paper in a reputable journal, then .... perhaps, maybe .... it would be possible to determine whether one argument carried a bit more weight than the other. If that were to occur we'd know that one group's stance was more than just an 'opinion' and that the other group was creating a generation of intellectually challenged dimwits. 
 Oh, wait a minute .... that's EXACTLY the nature of the debate as Richard Dawkins outlines in ""The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution"". With characteristic clarity and wit Dawkins creates a fascinating and passionate case for evolution by natural selection (based on scientific evidence) while simultaneously dismantling the intellectually dishonest ideas espoused by Creationists (who make up more than 40% of the US population, a figure that is simultaneously both disgraceful and embarrassing). 
 The two things I like most about Dawkins' writing is his ability to explain complex ideas clearly (without diluting them into a watery paste), and his talent for approaching a problem from a unique perspective - such as a gene as a selfish entity (selfish gene) or a pervasive idea as a virus (meme). This allows new insights to be developed, even if the reader is already familiar with much of the subject matter. 
 Many would benefit from a reading of ""The Greatest Show on Earth"". To do so, however, would require them to be convinced to spend more time critically examining and evaluating the scientific evidence and less time talking to their imaginary friend. An unlikely proposition at best.",0
6359544,"It is a shame that Richard Dawkins has bridged such a gap between himself and the religious, for he has such passion for evolution and is excellent at explaining it. Although this book is a little less focused than the others of his that I have read (perhaps because the subject matter is so broad), it is still an excellent overview of why evolution is true. Unfortunately, I'm afraid his condescending tone will prevent this book from appealing to those who do not already understand the subject, though I can't really see a creationist picking up this book, anyway. For those, on the other hand, who already known evolution to be true but only have a basic high school understanding of the process, this would be a great overview. Considering the number of Americans who don't believe evolution should be taught in schools, any book that explains the fascinating process of natural selection is a good thing, in my opinion. And also, I can't end this review without mentioning the gorgeous cover. It is stunning.",0

 James Patterson is one of those authors with whom I have a love-disappointment relationship. It's not dislike, in fact I can't help but read a lot of his books. And while there are certain books of his that I super love (like the Cradle and All and the Maximum Ride series), I'm not always impressed with his work (i.e. Honeymoon). I thought I was over my James Patterson fangirl mode, actually, until I picked up his Confessions series. Oh boy, it blew my mind. 
 After reading oh, about 38 books (Private School Murders being my 39th and I still have more on my Nook and bookshelves) by James Patterson, I have finally come to terms with his style of writing. His books usually have a lot going on. His main plot is interspersed with a lot of different things and most of the time, they don't relate to each other. So I more or less knew what I can expect from this latest book. 
 I've read the first Confessions book and it really puzzled me. A lot of things were going on with Tandy and I was just as confused as she was. But the conclusion, aaah, the conclusion was outstanding. And Confessions: Private School Murders did not disappoint. In fact, for me, it is one of James Patterson's most stellar works. But I am not discounting the contribution of Maxine Paetro, and I definitely felt her touch throughout the book. I've read so many James Patterson books after all, so I kind of have a feel for his writing style. Their collaboration has led to this page-turner and attention-grabbing book. I was so entranced, in fact, that I have put off taking a bath for two hours just so I could finish it. Oooh. Confession #1. 
 In Private School Murders, Tandy had three different mysteries going on: how to prove that her brother is innocent, is there something sinister going on at The Dakota due to the infestation of dangerous animals in the building, and who's killing all the private school girls in New York. All three were solved, although to be fair, she was only able to actually solve. The third one, well, she was just hit on the head with the answer. Hihihi. Pun intended. 
 After getting to know the chilling story behind the perfect, emotionless, robot-like Angel kids, here we see them growing into their own individuals, freed from the mind-controlling pills that they have been subjected to since kids. Tandy is coming to grips with all the memories and emotions piling all over her, as she has lived through fourteen years (she's already fifteen in the story and she stopped the pills the year before) without feeling anything. And while it may seem like she's only this exceptional woman because of the talent-enhancing meds, I think that her sleuthing skills are her own. She's like a modern-day, darker, more troubled Nancy Drew, and I love her for it. 
 A new character is introduced into their fold, Jacob, and if he was 25 years younger, I'd definitely want him to be my boyfriend. The twist at the end is both heartening and maddening at the same time. I'm very excited for the next chapter, not just about Tandy and James (oooh!) but about the Angel family as a whole. 
 The cover art of the book does not disappoint as well. It is very alluring and mysterious, just like the life of the Angels. I am very excited for more books in the series. I mean, they should (please please please) have more Confessions books. It's addicting. 
 And because James Patterson is awesome and wants to share the love of reading, some chapters of Confessions: The Private School Murders is available for free. 
 If you're a fan of crime, thriller, mystery, YA, with a dash of romance, try this one on for size.

Then the second half, he claims that scholars believe them to be random teachings, and literally doesn't comment at all!",0
325116,"Unless you can read the original, it is good to take two or more different translations and read them parallel (perhaps as practice, with a group). Since the version by Thich Nhat Hanh has already been cited, I'm adding this rendition, for triangulation. 
 The same approach is necessary for, say, Basho. 
 Speaking of literary translation, perhaps it is true that our recent, contemporary investigations into Sanskrit- and Chinese-based cultures constitutes a Renaissance II ; certainly, the West's translation of BuddhaDharma is a great engine for much outstanding literary translation of our time. 
 Once The Heart Sutra's been studied and practiced, there's this Diamond ... wisdom beyond wisdom.",1
325116,"I remember trying to read a volume of sutras which were the official translations from the Pali. It was so disappointing. Repetitive and abstruce, utterly unreadable in fact. I will admit that this was in part my fault. I didn't know the literature as well then. My knowledge is still virtually schematic, but I've come across a few good bibliographies in Armstrong and elsewhere that have led me to the present volume. It is a thoughtful, semi-coherent translation of two sutras from the Sanskrit: The Diamond Sutra and The Heart Sutra. The commentary is on target. (Except for the 10 pages or so of the Diamond Sutra when Conze offers no commentary at all, so impenetrable is the original text; this is just one way in which Conze seems careful to avoid discursive redoubts where there might be needless wheel spinning.) In other words, the book is well edited. My only word of caution would be to prepare yourself for the full out use of paradox. For a Westerner paradox can be frustrating. The text does ultimately make sense, but you may need to undergo multiple patient readings before it yields fully its charms. The process of reading such books, I have found, is like osmosis. One must immerse oneself in the text, and slowly the understanding of no-understanding comes about. But this book is mostly about how classical Buddhism was taught for many hundreds of years. For more direct access to the core of a streamlined form of American Buddhism that I have found transformative, I strongly recommend Pema Chodron's books, especially Start Where You Are: A Guide to Compassionate Living, The Places that Scare You: A Guide to Fearlessness in Difficult Times and When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times.",21

 It's that time of year again, when I decide to check in on Lt. Eve Dallas and her unbelievably wealthy and gorgeous husband Roarke. Just like a long-running TV show with characters and a setting I enjoy, these books are perfect vacation reading for me. 
 A Catholic priest is poisoned with sacramental wine during the funeral of one of the communities best-loved senior citizens. There are tons of witnesses and initially, it seems impossible that anyone could have anything against the popular and civic-minded father Miguel Flores. Then, across town, a hugely successful tele-evangelist is collapses on stage during one of his huge shows at Madison Square Garden. Are the murders connected, or is there a copycat at large? Can Dallas get over her discomfort with organised religion and genuine faith and discover who the murder (or murderers) are? 
 While the initial premise of this book was really cool, I thought the unravelling of the murder plot just took too long in this book. The motive for the killings is revealed before we're even halfway through the book and far too much time is spent just getting the guilty parties lured into confessing. I got bored waiting for the final act to really get going.",0

 Oh. My. Gosh. Can I just tell you how I cried almost the ENTIRE time I read this book? I can barely even type this out without tearing up all over again. I mean, this book was emotional to the maximum. 
 This will be fairly short compared to some of my usual rambly reviews because I don't want to give too much away. It really has to be experienced first hand to be appreciated for how epic it truly is. 
 This book is quite different from the previous three in the series. It is so so so fast-paced that it nearly blew me away. I also could not stop reading AT ALL. I neglected every single thing I had planned to do the day I read this. The whole book spans less than a 48 hour period. Most of it takes place in Avalon and it's a battle like you wouldn't believe. Pike stretched this battle out to a crazy length and she did it well. It was action packed and completely thrilling. 
 I have come to adore each of the characters in this book. Laurel, Tamani, David, and Chelsea. Each of these people play a special part in the battle to save Avalon from Klea and her horde. All four of them go through a change in this book and come to realizations they may not have if not for the situation at hand. 
 The romance? What can I say about it that wouldn't give something away? Not much. I can say that I am completely happy with how it all turned out. I was definitely able to breathe a huge sigh of relief at Laurel's ultimate decision. Not that there was really any contest, though, right? ;) 
 As for the ""Last Words"" portion of the book, it was sad. Very. But, I mean, Aprilynne warns you prior to reading it that it's not a ""happy ending"" to the story. It was the original ending she wanted for her story, and she has every right to put it there and I, for one, appreciated that she gave us the opportunity to choose whether or not we wanted to continue. I would still rate this book 5 stars whether she put that there or not, whether she warned us or not, whether she wrote ""two endings"" or not. It's still the perfect end to a series that I have loved from the beginning. 
 All in all, if you've been keeping up with this series, this is a finale that you cannot miss! I can say without a doubt that this book will make you cry your eyes out. I know I did. I had my trusty box of tissues right next to me once I realized Pike wasn't going to let up with the emotional onslaught. The battle is epic. The revelations are dramatic and some of them quite unexpected. Pike did not disappoint me one bit with this book and I will remember it always. It's beautifully tragic at times, but filled with hope, love, and determination all throughout. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Aprilynne Pike, for the most beautiful ending to your lovely series.

17163720,"'Council of Patriots' was full of twists and turns. The storyline pulled me in from the beginning and I was hooked. The way it played out held quite a few surprises that I didn't see coming. The characters were great. SSI is sure testing Cal and pushing his limits as to how he addresses and deals with scenarios. Daniel is a great addition to the team. He is definitely quite crafty. I'm not sure I liked how this book ended, but I had already planned on reading the next book, so it's all good. A great add to your tbr list.",0
