The Tao Te Ching: 81 Verses by Lao Tzu with Introduction and Commentary,7,4.32,"Tao Te Ching translates very roughly as ""the way of integrity."" In its 81 verses it delivers a treatise on how to live in the world with goodness and integrity: an important kind of wisdom in a world where many people believe such a thing to be impossible. Taosim affirms that each human being is a reflection of the whole universe, a microcosm within the macrocosm, and that all of us live under the same cosmic laws of the Tao. The Taoist follows the path of non-action (Wu Wei), flowing with the constantly changing stream of life, and trying to live in universal harmony and balance. The easily assimiliated aphorisms in this great book are a continuous source of spiritual guidance and nourishment, and its insights on statesmanship are practical guides for our own time. Ralph Alan Dale's brilliant translation uniquely captures, as never before, the essential meaning of this profound text, and makes it entirely relevant to today's readers.",2622245,Watkins Publishing,224.0,2017.0,31921810,7,Lao Tzu,small

"The Collected Letters of C.S. Lewis, Volume 2: Books, Broadcasts, and the War, 1931-1949",9,4.48,"C. S. Lewis was a prolific letter writer, and his personal correspondence reveals much of his private life, reflections, friendships, and the progress of his thought. This second of a three-volume collection contains the letters Lewis wrote after his conversion to Christianity, as he began a lifetime of serious writing. Lewis corresponded with many of the twentieth century's major literary figures, including J. R. R. Tolkien and Dorothy Sayers. Here we encounter a surge of letters in response to a new audience of laypeople who wrote to him after the great success of his BBC radio broadcasts during World War II -- talks that would ultimately become his masterwork, Mere Christianity.
Volume II begins with C. S. Lewis writing his first major work of literary history, The Allegory of Love, which established him as a scholar with imaginative power. These letters trace his creative journey and recount his new circle of friends, ""The Inklings,"" who meet regularly to share their writing. Tolkien reads aloud chapters of his unfinished The Lord of the Rings, while Lewis shares portions of his first novel, Out of the Silent Planet. Lewis's weekly letters to his brother, Warnie, away serving in the army during World War II, lead him to begin writing his first spiritual work, The Problem of Pain.
After the serialization of The Screwtape Letters, the director of religious broadcasting at the BBC approached Lewis and the ""Mere Christianity"" talks were born. With his new broadcasting career, Lewis was inundated with letters from all over the world. His faithful, thoughtful responses to numerous questions reveal the clarity and wisdom of his theological and intellectual beliefs.
Volume II includes Lewis's correspondence with great writers such as Owen Barfield, Arthur C. Clarke, Sheldon Vanauken, and Dom Bede Griffiths. The letters address many of Lewis's interests -- theology, literary criticism, poetry, fantasy, and children's stories -- as well as reveal his relation ships with close friends and family. But what is apparent throughout this volume is how this quiet bachelor professor in England touched the lives of many through an amazing discipline of personal correspondence. Walter Hooper's insightful notes and compre hensive biographical appendix of the correspon dents make this an irreplaceable reference for those curious about the life and work of one of the most creative minds of the modern era.",1069006,HarperOne,1152.0,2004.0,55274,95,C.S.

The Great War and the Shaping of the 20th Century,6,4.01,"The World War of 1914-1918, the Great War, was the first of the man-made disasters of the twentieth century. In many ways it was without precedent. Never had the battlefield been so vast, whether in the trenches, in the sky, or on and in the seas. Never had a war reached so deeply into the lives of people so far away from the battlefield. The shock waves generated by this cataclysmic event are felt to this day, as this dramatic narrative makes vividly clear. Here is presented a history of world war in a new way. The military flow of the conflict - from the invasion of Belgium in the summer of 1914 to the collapse of Germany in the autumn of 1918 - is followed throughout. But these epic events are rendered with fresh insights by the interweaving of the cultural history of the time - the hopes and dreams, the ideas and aspirations, the exhilaration and despair, both of those remote from power and of those who led them. This is a journey into the intense personal experiences of people trying to make sense of war on a scale the world had never seen. Like the acclaimed television series that it accompanies, The Great War pays special attention to the troubling aftermath of the war: the emergence of new nations amid old and festering problems; how the victims and survivors dealt with loss and disfigurement, guilt and hatred; and the terrible legacy of brutality that has marked so much of the twentieth century.",630869,Penguin Group,432.0,1996.0,1179502,61,Blaine Baggett,medium

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,6,4.06,"It would be an international crime to reveal too much of the jeweled clockwork plot of Le Carre's 1st masterpiece, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. But we are at liberty to disclose that Graham Greene called it the ""finest spy story ever written,"" & that the taut tale concerns Alec Leamas, a British agent in early Cold War Berlin. Leamas is responsible for keeping the double agents under his care undercover & alive, but East Germans start killing them, so he gets called back to London by Control, his spy master. Yet instead of giving Leamas the boot, Control gives him a scary assignment: play the part of a disgraced agent, a sodden failure everybody whispers about. Control sends him back out into the cold--deep into Communist territory to checkmate the bad-guy spies on the other side. The political chessboard is black & white, but in human terms the vicinity of the Berlin Wall is a moral no-man's land, a gray abyss patrolled by pawns. Le Carre beats most spy writers for two reasons. 1st, he knows what he's talking about, since he raced around working for British Intelligence while the Wall went up. He's familiar with spycraft's fascinations, but also with the fact that it leaves ideals shaken & emotions stirred. 2nd, his literary tone has deep autobiographical roots. Spying is about betrayal, & Le Carre was abandoned by his mother & betrayed by his father, a notorious con man. (They figure heavily in his novels Single & Single& A Perfect Spy.) In a world of lies, Le Carre writes the bitter truth: it's every man for himself & may the best mask win.--Tim Appelo",1411964,Sceptre,229.0,1999.0,1141891,78,John le Carre,small

Let it Go: Forgive So You Can Be Forgiven,70,4.31,"T.D.

He understands that he and fellow Christians share spiritual truths ""that transcend time and culture and reflect a universal understanding of human nature."" The spiritual truth he explores in Let It Go concerns forgiveness and why it is important for those on the receiving end of wrongful behavior as well as those who commit acts of wrongdoing.
""Forgiveness is a big idea and it works best when it is invested into people who have the courage to grasp the seven-foot-high idea of what's best for their future rather than the four-foot-high idea of recompense for what has happened in their past,"" Jakes writes in Let It Go. This book explores forgiveness as an idea and at the same time offers specific and clear actions for readers who seek to apply the idea in their daily lives. Offenses are a part of life, he says. But conflicts can be resolved and relationships do have a future, if we learn how to forgive. No matter how great or small the injustice, Jakes shows how the matter can be put behind you for the sake of a better tomorrow if you can Let It Go.",72902,Atria Books,272.0,2012.0,13508720,795,T.D.

The Essence of Buddhism: An Introduction to Its Philosophy and Practice,6,4.01,"This lucid overview of the Buddhist path takes the perspective of the three ""vehicles"" of Tibetan Buddhism: the Hinayana, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. While these vehicles are usually presented as a historical development, they are here equated with the attitudes that individuals bring to their Buddhist practice. Basic to them all, however, is the need to understand our own immediate condition. The primary tool for achieving this is meditation, and The Essence of Buddhism serves as a handbook for the various meditative approaches of Buddhist practice.
Beginning with the Four Noble Truths, Traleg Rinpoche incorporates the expansive vision of the bodhisattva path and the transformative vision of Tantra. The final chapters present the transcendent view of Mahamudra. This view dispenses with all dualistic fixations and directly realizes the natural freedom of the mind itself.
Along the way, the author provides vivid definitions of fundamental concepts such as compassion, emptiness, and Buddha-nature, and answers common questions: Why does Buddhism teach that there is ""no self""? Are Buddhist teachings pessimistic? Does Buddhism encourage social passivity? What is the role of sex in Buddhist Tantra? Why is it said that ""samsara is nirvana""? Does it take countless lifetimes to attain enlightenment, or can it be achieved in a moment?",103222,Shambhala,188.0,2001.0,418421,75,Traleg Kyabgon,small

Acts of War (Usurper's War #2),8,4.18,"Somehow I doubt that this is quite how anyone expected Adolf Hitler's death to turn out...--Squadron Leader Adam Haynes, No. 303 (Polish) Squadron
August 1942. London is in flames. Heinrich Himmler's Germany stands triumphant in the West, its ""Most Dangerous Enemy"" forced to the peace table by a hailstorm of nerve gas and incendiaries. With Adolf Hitler avenged and portions of the Royal Navy seized as war prizes, Nazi Germany casts its baleful gaze across the Atlantic towards an increasingly isolationist United States. With no causus belli, President Roosevelt must convince his fellow Americans that it is better to deal with a triumphant Germany now than to curse their children with the problem of a united, fascist Europe later.
As Germany and Japan prepare to launch the next phase of the conflict, Fate forces normal men and women to make hard choices in hopes of securing a better future. For Adam Haynes, Londonfall means he must continue an odyssey that began in the skies over Spain. American naval officer Eric Cobb finds that neutrality is a far cry from safety. Finally, Rear Admiral Tamon Yamaguchi must prepare himself and his men to fight a Pacific War that is far different than the surprise attack Imperial Japan had once planned but never executed.
Acts of War is the continuation of the Usurper's War series, which charts a very different World War II.

To Thee Is This World Given,7,4.38,"Provocative Novella Reveals the Complex Humanity of Survivors in a Post-Apocalyptic World
Two strangers intent upon their own survival meet on the road amid a pile of fallen corpses. As one flees the other, their tense and dramatic encounter begins. And over the next 24 hours they will force each other to confront what it means to be human in a world haunted by the dead.
In fluid, effortless prose, Milam gives readers a glimpse at the lives of a handful of survivors of a zombie apocalypse.
Always driving forward with no extraneous motion, To Thee Is This World Given is brilliantly imagined, expertly told and hard to put down.
With skillful dialog and exceptional description, Milam has created memorable, fully realized characters in a vivid world that is thoroughly grounded in the genre's tradition, but that is anything but cliched.
With overt nods to both The Walking Deadand The Road, those stalwarts of the unrelentingly nihilistic vision of human nature dominating the genre, Milam has taken up Daniel Drezner's call for post-apocalyptic narratives showcasing ""the adaptability, ingenuity, and creativity of human beings,"" joining the ranks of such authors as Kim Stanley Robinson and Cory Doctorow.",14078415,Eponym,107.0,2015.0,25700137,9,Khel Milam,small

Chess for Zebras,6,4.35,"Jonathan Rowson, author of the highly acclaimed Seven Deadly Chess Sins, investigates three questions important to all chess-players:
1) Why is it so difficult, especially for adult players, to improve?
2) What kinds of mental attitudes are needed to find good moves in different phases of the game?
3) Is White's alleged first-move advantage a myth, and does it make a difference whether you are playing Black or White?
In a strikingly original work, Rowson makes use of his academic background in philosophy and psychology to answer these questions in an entertaining and instructive way. This book assists all players in their efforts to improve, and provides fresh insights into the opening and early middlegame.
Rowson presents many new ideas on how Black should best combat White's early initiative, and make use of the extra information that he gains as a result of moving second. For instance, he shows that in some cases a situation he calls 'Zugzwang Lite' can arise, where White finds himself lacking any constructive moves. He also takes a close look at the theories of two players who, in differing styles, have specialized in championing Black's cause: Mihai Suba and Andras Adorjan. Readers are also equipped with a 'mental toolkit' that will enable them to handle many typical over-the-board situations with greater success, and avoid a variety of psychological pitfalls.
Chess for Zebrasoffers fresh insights into human idiosyncrasies in all phases of the game. The depth and breadth of this book will therefore help players to appreciate chess at a more profound level, and make steps towards sustained and significant improvement.",188,Gambit Publications,255.0,2003.0,328,52,Jonathan Rowson,small

Stephanie can't keep a car for more than forty-eight hours. Two men are trying to get her into bed. She has nothing to wear to the Mafia wedding. And there's an angry little man (don't call him a dwarf!) who won't leave her apartment.
Bail jumping in Trenton is down to small potatoes. Stephanie's only open case is a small bond for a small violation, committed by a small person who raises Stephanie's frustration level in big ways. So short of money and long on bills, Stephanie comes up with a plan--diversify! Signing on as an intern with entrepreneurial Super Bounty Hunter Ranger, Stephanie ventures into Ranger's mostly morally correct and marginally legal operations.
None of this makes vice cop Joe Morelli a happy man. The cop in him can't help but wonder as to the source of Stephanie's expensive new cars. And the rest of him, the man who's been friend and lover to Stephanie, can't help but wonder if there's more to the partnership than meets the eye.
The internship is downgraded to second priority when Uncle Fred goes missing. Even though Grandma Mazur is sure he was abducted by aliens, Stephanie sets out to look for Fred.

"Accidental Theft (Stolen by the Alpha Wolf, #1.1)",60,4.28,"PART 1: Shifter/Vampire Serial
Stolen by the Alpha Wolf is a follow on to Chosen by the Vampire Kings. I strongly recommend that you read this 6 part serial first.
The arrogant vampire kings have always proclaimed themselves to be the rulers of all the non-humans making war between the species inevitable. In order to win, it is imperative that the shifters steal the chosen human female. The alpha wolf will take her for himself thus weakening the position of the bastard kings. No heirs means no future for the vampires.
Something Ward didn't bank on was that the yellow bellied elves would turn tail forcing the wolves to flee or face defeat.
In desperation, one of Ward's pack members grabs a female vampire taking her with him to the wolves' hideout deep in the mountains. The alpha is forced to take responsibility of the female until the dust settles...there are things that she may not find out about the shifters...things that would put them at further disadvantage against the vampires. In a few short days he'll take her back to Sweetwater himself. It soon becomes clear that being in such close proximity to this refined, delicately beautiful creature is pure torture. A few days suddenly feels like a lifetime. How he longs to be able to get under her skin and make her lose a little bit of that ironclad control she's so desperate to hold onto. It doesn't help that some of the shifters want her dead whilst others wouldn't mind taking her for themselves. Shifter females are in short supply.
Stephany watches her estranged mate being struck with arrow after silver tipped arrow while she is dragged away by one of the enemy. Lance falls to his knees, dying from his wounds, just as Stephany is knocked unconscious. After accidentally mating Lance twenty years ago, she has remained celibate ever since. So long she no longer even craves the touch of another, so long she doesn't even go into heat anymore. Forced to remain at the alphas side, her resolve is sorely tested. Suddenly she's feeling things she shouldn't be feeling, her own body is betraying her in worst of ways. She needs to stay strong. Especially since Ward is a wolf and she vampire...sworn enemies.
Accidental Theft is Part 1 of a 3 part serial and is approximately 26,000 words/104 pages. Make sure you read Chosen by the Vampire Kings first for the most enjoyment.
