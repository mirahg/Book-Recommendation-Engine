## Final Project for DS4300 at Northeastern University

### Mirah Gordon, Sara Adra, Anika Das, Genny Jawor

Final project utilizing MongoDB and Neo4j to create a book recommendation system.

Data sourced from UCSD's Goodreads dataset (https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home).

Two jupyter notebook notebooks contain all the necessary code for this project:

* Books_Mongo has code for loading in data with MongoDB and cleaning data into an exportable form for Neo4j.

* User_Books has code for a front-end user interface where a user is asked to input four books (title and author) and book recommendations are produced via a connection to MongoDB and Neo4j.

Other documents included in this repository are the output csv's from data cleaning and the final project report that was submitted.
